Hi, I participated in this ctf as a solo player and I'll just be giving my solve scripts to the pwn challenges I solved

I'm currently too busy to make a writeup but i'll try to give a detailed solution soon once i'm done with my school exams :)

I focused mainly on solving pwn/rev and here are the ones i was able to solve

I must say I really enjoyed solving the challenges and I learnt a lot!
