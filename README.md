## Write-ups

A collection of write-ups from various Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions.

I mainly focus on `pwn` and `reverse engineering`, so most of the content revolves around it.

This repository serves as a way for me to organize my solutions, notes, and files from the CTFs I participate in, as well as challenges I practice on.

## Structure

- practice/ - challenges I work on during my free time (solved or still in progress)

- misc/ - miscellaneous content not directly related to pwn or reversing

- 202(3|4|5) - solve scripts, notes, binaries, and write-ups from CTFs I’ve participated in

## Index

As I continue working, I plan to index my scripts to make it easier to reference and reuse particular techniques.
