This challenges were made by @mug3njutsu and I really enjoyed solving it :)

### Conundrum

Attached file: [link](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/blob/main/posts/ctf/bsides_nairaobi/Conundrum/conundrum.zip)

We are given a zip file which contained a binary, libc and ld file when unzipped

First thing I did was to patch the binary using [pwninit](https://github.com/io12/pwninit) so as to make sure the binary uses the same libc as the remote instance does 

Now I checked the file type and protections enabled on it
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/6838a330-70e3-4c2f-8127-6d179b3dbe66)

So we're working with a x64 binary which is dynamically linked and not stripped

And from the result gotten from running `checksec` we can see that all protections are enabled!

I ran the binary to get an overview of what it does
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/d40b9ea8-d6a6-4846-a987-b47b3870dcde)

Hmmmm it seems to receive our input and prints it out back

To find the vulnerability I decompiled the binary in Ghidra and here's the main function
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/ad0a4ac6-8ca0-45ae-b5e6-7ac9ec462ff9)

```c
undefined8 main(void)

{
  long in_FS_OFFSET;
  char choice [5];
  long canary;
  
  canary = *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28);
  setup();
  write(1,&DAT_00100b70,0xbb);
  read(0,choice,5);
  if (choice[0] == '1') {
    puts("Go back to where you came!");
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    exit(0);
  }
  if (choice[0] == '2') {
    question();
    write(1,"You wanna tell me a little bit more about pointers?(y/n): ",0x3a);
    read(0,choice,5);
    if (choice[0] == 'y') {
      question();
    }
    else if (choice[0] == 'n') {
      puts("Cheers mate!!");
    }
    else {
      puts("It\'s either yay or nay :)");
    }
    if (canary != *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28)) {
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
      __stack_chk_fail();
    }
    return 0;
  }
  puts("It\'s either 1 or 2 :)");
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
  exit(0);
}
```

So.... if we choose the first option it would just exit which is not so helpful

And the next choice is option 2 which would call the `question()` function

Here's the pseudo code for the function
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/ebb0b3b3-04ce-4231-bc83-356c1b8d42a3)

```c
void question(void)

{
  long in_FS_OFFSET;
  char buffer [136];
  long canary;
  
  canary = *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28);
  memset(buffer,0,0x80);
  write(1,"Educate me, what\'s so interesting about pointers: ",0x32);
  read(0,buffer,256);
  printf(buffer);
  if (canary != *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28)) {
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    __stack_chk_fail();
  }
  return;
}
```

What this does is basically:
- Defines a buffer which can hold up to 136 bytes
- Reads in at most 256 bytes of our input which is going to be stored in the buffer
- Uses printf to print out our provided input

Looking at the code they are two obvious vulnerability:
- Buffer overflow
- Format string bug

There's a buffer overflow because it reads in at most 256 bytes of input which is stored in a buffer that can only hold up 136 bytes giving us an extra 120 bytes to write. And the format string bug exists because it prints out our input without using a format specifier

So what now?

Well after the function is called we are given the choice to call it again

```c
write(1,"You wanna tell me a little bit more about pointers?(y/n): ",0x3a);
read(0,choice,5);
if (choice[0] == 'y') {
  question();
}
else if (choice[0] == 'n') {
  puts("Cheers mate!!");
}
```

What next? How do we go about exploitation!

Because `FULL RELRO` is enabled this means the global offset table is just read only which we can confirm by looking at the memory mapping in gdb
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/94968d22-70ed-45ae-9ac6-5c4d862cfb2b)

The values in the got are in that binary address range which has just `read` permission set on it, so `Got Overwrite` isn't liable 

What next?

Well since there's a buffer overflow we can just overwrite the instruction pointer to jump to a one_gadget

The catch there is that Canary is watching 👀 which would prevent us from doing a stack based overflow

But that isn't an issue because we can use the format string bug to leak the canary

The idea of canary is simple in the sense that it would generate a random value which would be stored on the stack and later compared before the program returns
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/c7f37dbd-2a1f-4732-8c73-dc87316f52c8)
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/3761d60a-366a-4499-81e9-46ef3bce1e6e)

So the canary is placed after our input buffer meaning if we do an overflow it would overwrite the value stored in the canary and when the comparism which checks if the canary still has it's right value is done at the time the program wants to return it would return `False` because we have overwritten it therefore it calls the `__stack_chk_fail` function

The way to go around this is to overwrite the canary to it's right value this is going to be possible because we can leak the canary via the format string bug

One thing about canary which can be used to identify it is that it ends with a null byte `00` 
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/e47468c2-5497-4f7f-808c-41c578718ecb)

Now let's do the good stuff :)

The exploit chain is simple:
- Leak canary and libc address
- Buffer overflow to jump to one_gadget in libc

To do the leak I wrote a fuzz script which basically leaks values off the stack and shows me it's offset

Here's the fuzz script: [link](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/blob/main/posts/ctf/bsides_nairaobi/Conundrum/fuzz.py)

Running it gives this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/350b7e76-1eb9-4f2a-be00-aa84493bd3e7)

From the result being leaked off the stack we can see that at offset 23 hold the canary value which we can confirm it being right 
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/b1ff62ca-facf-4ff5-8f08-1726dc46d93c)
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/b00bbdda-3552-42a6-8014-88bcd9329530)

And at offset 29 holds some libc address value
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/29699e4a-f353-4239-92b3-ecd1f154d250)
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/f54eee93-e2ac-4166-8ee8-7e18a07dcacc)

If we have a libc leak we can calculate the libc base address by subtracting it with (known leak - known libc base)
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/8f215432-ade3-48e8-b225-0fce6dbb6012)

At this point we should have the libc base address now we need to make use of the buffer overflow to overwrite the RIP to a one gadget
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/7ca8e801-c85f-429a-8696-7018eac173a3)

That's all!

So the final thing is to overwrite the canary with it's original value and you can easily get the offset from looking at Ghidra stack layout
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/d1b6959e-2314-4a42-8a44-b97839f182ba)

The offset to reach the canary is `0x98 - 0x10 = 0x88`, then we need to overwrite saved rbp with random values since it's not going to be later used and then finally the return address to the one gadget address

Here's the final exploit script: [link](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/blob/main/posts/ctf/bsides_nairaobi/Conundrum/solve.py)

Running it would spawn a shell 
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/d249ff5a-8a50-4f43-af54-b5a0c22670fc)


### Simple

Attached file: [link](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/blob/main/posts/ctf/bsides_nairaobi/Simple/simple.zip)

We are given a zip file which contained a binary, libc and ld file when unzipped

I basically followed the same process I did in this first binary challenge (patching, file type & protection)

But later on you will see there's no need to patch the binary to use the remote libc it's just a good practice I guess 🤔

Checking the file type and the protection enabled on the binary shows this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/177e9587-9e39-43bb-807e-e9a5fd952353)

So we're working with a x64 binary which is dynamically linked and not stripped

The only protection not enabled is "Canary"

I ran the binary to get an overview of what it does
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/38c52af8-8717-4c13-a2d6-3eefc64b47e2)

So it's clear that it would receive our input twice while the first one prints our input back and the second one just receives our input and exit

On decompiling the binary with Ghidra here's the main function
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/56c3a3b2-1d03-4627-bd3b-e52ab25b9ca1)

```c
undefined8 main(void)

{
  undefined8 buffer;
  undefined8 local_50;
  undefined8 local_48;
  undefined8 local_40;
  undefined8 local_38;
  undefined8 local_30;
  undefined8 local_28;
  undefined8 local_20;
  code *notcalled;
  undefined8 *ptr;
  
  setup();
  ptr = (undefined8 *)mmap((void *)0x999999000,0x1000,3,0x21,-1,0);
  notcalled = ::notcalled;
  fwrite("Tell me, what\'s your strategy here: ",1,0x24,stdout);
  read(0,&buffer,64);
  printf("Riiiiight, %s",&buffer);
  *ptr = buffer;
  ptr[1] = local_50;
  ptr[2] = local_48;
  ptr[3] = local_40;
  ptr[4] = local_38;
  ptr[5] = local_30;
  ptr[6] = local_28;
  ptr[7] = local_20;
  fwrite("This might actually come to fruition. Try fire it up: ",1,0x36,stdout);
  fgets((char *)&buffer,200,stdin);
  return 0;
}
```

Here's what it does:
- Sets up a virtual memory space at address `0x999999000` of size `0x1000` with `PROC_READ & PROC_WRITE` permission
- Then it receives our input which reads at most 64 bytes of our input and stored in the buffer
- It uses printf to display the buffer content
- It does some variable assigning and I don't really know the reason :(
- Uses fgets to read in input to the buffer which reads in at most 200 bytes

Looking at this we can tell there's a buffer overflow during the time it receives our input the second time

But we can't do anything for now because PIE is enabled

There's a way to leak it and that's through using printf since it receives 64 bytes of our input, and the thing about printf is that it would print until receiving a null byte

Looking at the stack after it receives the first input I saw this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/d3ef6f98-38ed-4658-a9dc-ae8619e31a76)

So if we are to fill up the buffer it would overwrite the null byte then printf would leak that `notcalled` function address

And the amount of bytes to fill up the buffer is 64 before we can leak the `notcalled` function address
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/3235db39-035a-4400-be72-5a515fd0ff67)

At this point we know there's a way to leak an elf section addresses therefore having the elf base address
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/a377ce72-6a3b-488b-977c-fc7c601848bb)

This chall so far is somewhat similar to the one I solved at Cyberlympics 2023 Prequal here's the writeup: [link](https://h4ckyou.github.io/posts/ctf/cyberlympics22/prequal/writeup.html)

But the difference now is that I was able to ROP using Ret2Libc in that challenge but it doesn't work here?

Since `printf` is being used, normally it can be used to leak the got values but I tried to see what the value is during runtime and I got this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/e2755ea3-f222-4c09-85eb-d64a09a298f3)

Wow pwntools is saying there's no attribute called `got` which means there's no resolved libc function during the execution?

I then confirmed by running that script in a debugger and on checking the got shows this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/7ff4ce5f-5c25-41f3-9378-a4ad63768f6b)

We can clearly see that no any resolved libc function is there which means we can't possibly leak libc address

At this point what next?

Since this is `mug3njutsu` I had it in mind that this is solvable even though it starts looking hard (but the challenge name is `simple` 🥲)

So I decided to check the available rop gadgets present in the binary
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/069e34ed-0fc9-415b-893e-0fcf58e6d5e1)
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/a3109bfb-996c-4e79-ae50-71b0642716ee)
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/8043dd6f-0e81-4cd0-b3a6-009bd6e6ae33)

Looking at that I could clearly see a `pop rax & syscall` gadget 

With this we can potentially call `execve('/bin/sh', NULL, NULL)`

But we need three gadget to set up the argument in the register to achieve that
- RDI --> '/bin/sh'
- RSI --> 0
- RDX --> 0

I saw an easy `[pop rdi; ret] & [pop rsi, pop r15; ret]` gadget but that wasn't the case for `rdx`

There's no gadget that allows us control the `rdx` register

But looking at other gadgets I came across: 
- xor rsi, rsi
- xor rdx, rdx

Ok this is worth using cause when you xor a register with it's register it will null out the register 

So at this point we have a way to set `rsi & rdx` to `0` and now we need to set `rdi --> addr --> '/bin/sh'`

And yes to pass in `/bin/sh` to the `rdi` register we need to pass it as an address pointing to `/bin/sh` and not a string

They wasn't any `mov` gadget to gives us the `write-what-where` primitive so I had to come up with another way of using `/bin/sh` already in memory

I ran the binary in gdb and after it receives our first input I searched for it and it happens to be stored in the virtual memory created 
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/29b03633-7052-429c-b074-4ddf536db76d)

That's so because the buffer content is going to be stored in the virtual memory space created:

```c
ptr = (undefined8 *)mmap((void *)0x999999000,0x1000,3,0x21,-1,0);
*ptr = buffer;
```

Because the address `0x999999000` is always going to be the same this means we have a way of writing '/bin/sh' to memory

The way I went about writing to memory is by using the last 8 byte address `0x999999038+1`
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/1dda5996-6232-45a0-be65-243332e305d4) 

So instead of me spamming with 'A's like I'd normally do for the leaking part I actually spammed it with a space character:

```
- payload = ' '*57 + '/bin/sh'
```

This is to make sure that the address would just have `/bin/sh` and no other messy characters
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/79f623bf-6dbf-4fbc-8df6-f318c7b44960)

At this point we have a way to set all register and now the rop chain should work

Here's my final exploit: [link](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/blob/main/posts/ctf/bsides_nairaobi/Simple/solve.py)
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/4e859bfc-1a4a-48d3-ab19-9a59a5365bfd)


### Short

Attached file: [link](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/blob/main/posts/ctf/bsides_nairaobi/Short/short)

Only a binary was given and checking the file type and protection enabled I got this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/c57fe606-3109-4ad9-b77e-e8153d23ba4f)

So we're working with a x64 binary which is statically linked and not stripped

The protections enabled are the standard `mug3njutsu` protection but something interesting is that it has RWX segments basically that means during the program execution the stack would be readable, writeable and executable

And yes by the way it's a Statically linked binary meaning that all C functions are going to be in the binary rather than it being called from a libc library file

Then I ran the binary to get an overview of what it does
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/52f9ca20-a1b7-4f28-ab8f-378793382881)

Nice it prints out some fancy keyboard banner then receives our input and seems to exit

Next thing I did was to decompile the binary in Ghidra and it generously directs us to to main function 
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/6274f99d-fc35-41c6-93b0-dcbb15428a6d)

```c
undefined8 main(void)

{
  setup();
  junk();
  chall();
  if (x != 0xcc07c9) {
    notcalled();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

So basically it calls the `setup()` function which does some buffering
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/4420fc50-ab49-454b-8054-77fd1472dd4b)

Next it calls the `junk()` function which display the fancy keyboard design
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/66d56325-1f54-4bac-b6f3-3b9e46bdb6bf)

And finally the `chall()` function

![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/789f39fe-ba11-4d7d-ba42-e7646898fb47)

```c

void chall(void)

{
  undefined buffer [48];
  
  write(1,
        "Gotta say, coming up with a whole backstory for a chall is hard! Anyway, what\'s your appro ach here: "
        ,100);
  read(0,buffer,256);
  return;
}
```

So it will display some words then receive our input using `read()` which will be stored in a buffer that can only hold up 48 bytes but we are given at most 256 bytes to read in

Therefore there's a buffer overflow in this function

Then after the program returns it does this comparism of the global variable `x` to `0xcc07c9` 

The value stored there is already `0xcc07c9` meaning the comparism would return False
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/e8ff0e73-162b-49da-85e2-24f5cc0fafc0)

But if it was to be different it would call the `notcalled()` function
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/4afc3fec-29c3-4a89-8d16-d9bb293d8101)

```c

void notcalled(void)

{
  undefined shellcode [8];
  
  write(1,"You managed to get here, awesome! Can i please have your autograph: ",0x44);
  read(0,shellcode,8);
  (*(code *)shellcode)();
  return;
}
```

And what this function will basically do is to run a 8 bytes shellcode received from us

We can't really reach the function for now because there's no way of overwriting the global variable `x` to another value 

I'm thinking it's there so as for us to see there's a function which isn't called by main directly 

But the fact we can't overwrite the global variable doesn't mean we can't call the function cause after all there's a buffer overflow?

Hmmmm but remember that PIE is enabled meaning that the binary memory address would be different each time the program runs

So I decided to see how it looks like in a debugger when I overwrite the instruction pointer
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/8ff79e51-4399-4716-a781-e890a08fd428)
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/cabfe695-3bbc-4f87-add9-5ac905d6645e)

Ok cool the offset is 56 now I decided to look at the way the overwrite works and saw this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/867425b1-e2d5-4bdf-85a7-43f366e10f39)
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/8474d79e-a31f-4b37-8eec-7b5ecc8595e8)

That's nice we can see that it overwrote the last 2 bytes of the rip which basically means overwriting would start from the end of the address (lsb or ??)

In our case we can see `0xa4141` the `0xa` is caused when i entered the "Enter" key 

At this point we can basically call the `notcalled` function but how?

The address of the function is always going to be different because of PIE but the last offset won't change
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/48766dfd-1ea8-47b7-a388-4df7fa2eb900)

So that address would be always different but the last 3 nibbles would always be the same

And because we can overwrite the last two bytes this means during the time we are overwriting we need to know the first nibble (??)

For example:
- We can overwrite 0x1337 to 0x4141
- But the thing is that address would always be different: 0x2337, 0x3337, 0x4337, 0x5337 etc.
- Though we see that the last three nibble are always the same
- So if we are to overwrite the need the known first nibble 0x**d**337

Hopefully you get what I mean!

So it sounds maybe not possible because it always changes. But the chances of getting it right is 1 outta 15 trials

That means we just need to make the exploit script run 15 times and then in one of the iteration you would get the right value

Now what next?

In order to achieve the loop part I made this function:
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/15e9baf0-8147-4fc8-981d-9c4b73a4a9c0)

It works! But I prefer working with ASLR disabled so that the offset would be the same and less tiresome (afterall we will be waiting for the script to loop 15 times)

So I made this function to work with that
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/c236dee6-7797-47c6-be86-4940dfd10804)

To disable ASLR run this:

```
- echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
```

Now we can safely jump to the `notcalled` function

Let's see what this function provides for us

From the decompilation earlier we saw that it would run 8 bytes shellcode given

But ideally that's too small for us to do anything

In this case I would love to spawn a shell but 8 bytes is just too small for our shellcode size!

So what now?

Well why don't read in a larger input size and cast the input as code 🤔

That's exactly what I did:- A two staged shellcode (i think that's what they call it)

For us to read in a larger input size I used the read syscall

```
rax = 0x0
read(unsigned int fd, char *buf, size_t count)
```

If we try to use something like that we would see the size exceeds 8

Jeez 25 bytes (But of cause they are ways to make it way smaller..... but I couldn't achieve that!)

So instead this is what i did:
- Made use of register already inplace

If we take a look at the register before it calls our shellcode you should see this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/6eb7a39b-16fc-4b79-8b77-fa850133c8f2)

```
RAX is already set to 0x0: mov eax,0x0
RDI is already set to 0x0: mov edi,0x0
RDX size is already too much: lea rdx,[rbp-0x8]
```
So our only concerning register is `RSI` though it's going to be the same value as `RDX` but I had issue with that so I decided to use another register

Now let us inspect the registeres during runtime before it calls our shellcode

They are other registers that hold a stack address but I made use of the `R13` register which is actually a pointer to another stack address and that pointer holds the binary full path name

Now we can limit the shellcode size

Cool our first staged shellcode size is just 7 bytes 

Then we can make the second staged shellcode call `execve('/bin/sh', NULL, NULL)` which would spawn a shell 🙂

This the shellcode I've edited and used

Compared to pwntools shellcraft generated shellcode length it's just 23 bytes 

With that said that's all :P

We can test it by running it

Oh yes ASLR is still disabled :(

Well you can still enable it and the exploit would work as long as you comment the `aslr_off` function and uncomment the `main` function

To enabled ASLR do this:

```
- echo 2 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
```

On running the exploit it would spawn a shell

Ah the moment the shell finally spawned I was like woohhhhhoooooooooo cause I spent 4 good hours trying to solve this 🥰
