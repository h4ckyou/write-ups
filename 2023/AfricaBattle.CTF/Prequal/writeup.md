### Misc 6/7 :~

#### Discord

After joining the discord channel and viewing the `announcement` I saw the flag
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/940d1887-ff3e-4e20-ac84-fe8a238df8ab)

#### Way

After downloading the attached file checking the file type shows it is a zip file archive
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/7772ffbf-77f1-44ab-a3c9-683c6f29f00a)

I tried to unzip it but I got this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/1150a6fc-d214-46b5-8784-867a30b2c535)

With this I know that it will require a password if I try to unzip using `7z` 

So let us brute force the password

I converted it to a format john can understand using `zip2john`
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/e50380b7-2602-41d0-b61a-729d0372adb7)

The password is `samoanpride` 

Let us unzip it now
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/579712f5-75bf-4a95-b906-92bd86623a17)

It unzipped to form an image file

Checking the image shows the `BUG|PWN` logo
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/2f45845b-ce17-4586-8cb7-c068d185a2e4)

Using strings showed me the password and from there I can filter it to get the last line in which the password is

It gave this string:

```
onggyrPGS{RaqGvzr_vf_terng}
```

I used [dcoder.fr](https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier) to identify the type of cipher it is
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/b35a9c43-b1ee-410d-8fed-d6440f69a292)

It says it is `ROTed` 

I then decoded it using [this](https://www.dcode.fr/rot-13-cipher)

We are given ssh credential to login with

After I logged in using:

```
ssh battlectf@chall.battlectf.online -p 30000 -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-dss
```

I saw this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/714bbd60-0564-473d-9287-b2271f2a1873)

Seems we are in a restriced environment!!

I ran `bash` and it seemed to broke out of it
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/93503b8a-c0f2-41a1-94e8-09927afc44b9)

Still I can't run commands

After playing with some characters I figured using command injection payloads work quite well

And I got the flag that way

### BUG|PWN
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/6da61151-dfca-43c6-b4af-b3c1e25c0a94)

After going to the twitter page of the [BUG|PWN](https://twitter.com/0xbugpwn/status/1672272446257340417) organizers I found some hex values
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/7cdc216a-76b3-40bc-bd7b-bf492785032b)

Well those hex values are the messages while the key is the founder's name `RAVEN` 

I wrote a script to decode it 🙂

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from pwn import xor
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

cipher = b'\x0e\x39\x60\x77\x12\x2a\x77\x67\x19\x36\x65\x75\x0a\x3d\x79\x66\x1d\x2e\x73\x2d\x0e\x39\x60\x70\x12\x2a\x75\x65\x19\x36\x67\x75\x0a\x3d\x7a\x64\x1d\x2e\x72\x2c\x0e\x39\x62\x77\x12\x2a\x74\x63\x19\x36\x66\x76\x0a\x3d\x79\x31\x1d\x2e\x70\x7e\x0e\x39\x63\x72\x12\x2a\x75\x33\x19\x36\x67\x27\x0a\x3d\x7a\x31\x1d\x2e\x73\x28\x0e\x39\x61\x73\x12\x2a\x77\x63\x19\x36\x65\x72\x0a\x3d\x7b\x34\x1d\x2e\x70\x7b\x0e\x39\x65\x75\x12\x2a\x76\x6e\x19\x36\x61\x71\x0a\x3d\x79\x6a\x1d\x2e\x72\x2a'
key = b'RAVEN'

xored = xor(cipher, key).decode()
print(f'H3X: {xored}')

Running it decodes to this

For some reason python `bytes.fromhex` doesn't work on it so I used cyberchef

We are given the source and also the web service url

To be honest I didn't take a look at the source 😃

After going to the web service I saw the header to be this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/bbca78f0-8f50-4232-95c7-6e17d2524c78)

The user agent header value looks interesting:

```
PHP/8.1.0-dev
```

Searching for exploits leads [here](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49933)

Running it works and we are root on the docker container

But the flag isn't there. 

I then used `find` command to get the path to where the flag is 
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/b2a06d38-e047-429f-b036-118bd6fbfbef)

### Web 8/10 :~

#### Civilization
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/5c8c1db4-b900-4284-b233-7290325bb062)

Going over to the web service shows this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/afd0b9b2-5275-46c1-9a42-03749fc372fb)
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/61070af0-fe48-4b1a-8bbe-b737c7fc072e)

Since the text says we should get the source code by going to `/?source` let us get it
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/3594b883-6a0a-4782-a942-e2f025923cd0)

From the page source we get this:

```php
<?php
require("./flag.php");
if(isset($_GET['source'])){
    highlight_file(__FILE__);  
}
if(isset($_GET['ami'])){
    $input = $_GET['ami'];
    $cigar = 'africacradlecivilization';
    if (preg_replace("/$cigar/",'',$input) === $cigar) {
        africa();
    }
}
include("home.html");
?>
```

We can tell what it does:
- Checks if the GET parameter `ami` is set
- If it returns true then the value of the parameter is set as the `input` variable
- The text `africacradlecivilization` is set as the cigar variable
- It does a preg replace on the value of input and cigar
- If the value formed after preg replace is done is equal to the cigar value we get the into the africa function which should likely contain the flag

From this we know that we need to make the input value to be `africacradlecivilization` in order to get the flag

But the issue is after preg_replace is done it will check that input is it contains `africacradlecivilization` and replace it with null values

How do we bypass it?

We can do this:

```
africaafricacradlecivilizationcradlecivilization
```

Now after preg replace removes the `africacradlecivilization` from that string it then forms `africacradlecivilization` 

Let us get the flag now

#### Own Reality

Going over to the web page shows this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/0ad76c5b-c73b-4893-90af-d577132b7942)

Immediately my `DogGit` firefox extension showed that there's an exposed `/.git` 
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/421f8c9a-9c1f-47e0-8603-4cffe31eaa85)

Going over to `/.git` shows that it is indeed there
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/69909769-e643-41b8-aafc-eaecf938f115)

I'll use `git-dumper` to dump the git repo
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/9b25ff75-45ee-4847-97df-ba5c713d6b4b)

Now that is done let us check the commit using `git log`
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/2710bb92-76c7-44df-9d62-7a3577d33d3a)

I can view the commit `a1346a3abab8f97748e5480b61eb6824d4692f44` using `git show a1346a3abab8f97748e5480b61eb6824d4692f44`
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/cbdfca62-5b6b-4daf-bd81-8bff15df7675)

We can see this:

```
.__..._..__...._.___._...___._...__.__...__.._._._....__._._._..._...__..____.__._._._._.__.___..__._.__.__.___..__.____.___.___.__.___.._._____.__..._..__._.._.___._...___..__._._____..__..__..___.....__._...__.._._.__.._._.__...._..__._....___.._.__..._...__._....__..._..__.___.__.._._.__.._._..__.._..__..__..__..__...__._._.__...._..__..._..__..__.__..__..__..._..__.._...__...__.__...__.__...._..__.__..__..__...__..__..__.._...__.___._____._
```

It looks like morse code but after decoding it from morse doesn't give the flag

After trying hours on this I then tried to convert the dots to 0 and underscores to 1

I wrote a script to do that

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

encoded = ".__..._..__...._.___._...___._...__.__...__.._._._....__._._._..._...__..____.__._._._._.__.___..__._.__.__.___..__.____.___.___.__.___.._._____.__..._..__._.._.___._...___..__._._____..__..__..___.....__._...__.._._.__.._._.__...._..__._....___.._.__..._...__._....__..._..__.___.__.._._.__.._._..__.._..__..__..__..__...__._._.__...._..__..._..__..__.__..__..__..._..__.._...__...__.__...__.__...._..__.__..__..__...__..__..__.._...__.___._____._"
decode1 = encoded.replace('.', '0')
decode2 = decode1.replace('_', '1')
print(decode2)
```

Running it gives this

Going over to the web service shows this

The apache version looks interesting
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/4aad0eea-1625-400b-b54d-5ba9fea5ed2c)

```
Apache/2.4.49
```

Searching for exploits leads [here](https://github.com/CalfCrusher/Path-traversal-RCE-Apache-2.4.49-2.4.50-Exploit/blob/main/main.py) 

From the source it does a directory transversal by using `.%2e`

Running the exploit shows it works
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/e2c8a909-5c37-4d65-9437-01866f89bc78)

Since we want to look for the flag I decided to do it manually
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/25157e23-1276-4fe8-a2b6-8cdfef83262a)

The flag is at `/flag.txt` but when I try access it I get 404 error
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/f0a4567f-a41d-4132-90b2-588c65ca9c1e)

So here's what I did

Since we know we can read a direct file `/etc/passwd` I can just go back one directory and get the flag `/etc/passwd/../flag.txt`
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/d34ca430-b485-4b4b-b83a-50ccfc6c103b)

Checking wappalyzer shows it is PHP but is it ?

![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/b78344fa-1490-4571-8c87-1b2d4b42ffd7)

Now that the web server language is confirmed let us get to solving it

Checking the page source shows how it excepts the capital to be guessed
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/395db72a-a279-439d-92c7-c3a82d0b3e5d)

```
<!-- IP?capital=Benin -->
```

Doing that I noticed this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/22757e57-ef77-45b8-91c3-6730c1e3df7e)

We can now try SSTI payload since our input value seems to be rendered back

And our payload gets evaluated
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/353e39d9-0f7b-4eec-995f-78531325debc)

Checking the config doesn't really show any thing interesting
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/eb2a9b46-8f71-433f-b8ea-0336b343ca05)

Let us get remote code execution then

I used a payload gotten from [PayloadAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Server%20Side%20Template%20Injection#exploit-the-ssti-by-calling-ospopenread)
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/03fc99de-7789-42b8-9384-ac031310f826)

#### Africa [First Blood 🩸]

Going over to the web service shows this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/92d8cd58-1ff4-4f0b-9944-aef72923d971)

Since this is a http-header based sorta web chall let us play with the header from burp

I changed the `User-Agent` to `africa` and got this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/eb7baa85-fdab-4ed6-bcb4-b8a3053fa046)

Hmm it's saying that it isn't coming from `local client` 

I can use the `X-Forwarded-For` header
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/7a7dcd7a-4f61-4f46-a76f-327a5fa545cd)

Now I get that error

We can use the `Referer` header for that
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/6a5fb78a-2938-4017-a46b-8f990f7ad446)

Since this is based on the tracking header which is `DNT` 

I'll set it to 1 and I got the flag
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/dc53882f-b987-44f0-8767-2eeb15f7927c)

Instead of doing that manually I made a script for it 

```python

#### Hebiosso injection 

Going over to the web service shows this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/04e44e8a-6bd4-4b06-a439-d09226606e46)

One thing we can try here is sql injection 🙂

I saved the search request to a file
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/add106d2-7f3b-4f68-88b8-239d5cc0f176)

Now we can use sqlmap to get check it

Doing that shows it is vulnerable to `UNION query` sql injection

Let us get the database present
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/e6ebac90-4f69-4b84-9d4e-15e135f3f32e)

So the database is `hebiosso` now let us get the tables present
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/b122ac02-3074-424f-8cf8-da43ab4ad5ec)

#### Cobalt Injection 2 [First Blood 🩸]

Seems they added like a filter of some sort

After playing with it I figured it filters dot and underscores 

Looking at [this](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Server%20Side%20Template%20Injection#jinja2---filter-bypass)

I got the payload to be used and we can see it worked
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/15f339ef-49ca-40bc-8882-348fdede3d96)

```
Note: Since dot is filtered I did 'cat flag\x2etxt'
```

And here's the flag

```

I saved the post request to a file to check for sql injection

And it turned out to be a time based sql injection

From the details it seems we need to get some values from the file attached

The file attached is an image file
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/1d56ba76-659c-43d3-8647-2199dd3ac4c8)

And the details we need are:
- Make
- Camera Model
- Front/Back
- Country
- City

Let us use `exiftool` to get the image metadata
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/0c1131f0-aa8e-4936-bced-a79898f8f98c)

Now we have the:
- Make == Google
- Camera Model == Pixel4XL
- Front/Back == Back

How do we get the country and city?

The metadata also gave the GPS Position to be:

```
6 deg 20' 59.76" N, 2 deg 24' 48.96" E
```

We can use a gps to location checker for this 

And after doing that I got [this](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Boulevard+de+la+Marina,+Cotonou,+Benin/@6.350245,2.4183454,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x102354572323f069:0x55e3471d46e14f66!8m2!3d6.350245!4d2.4183454!16s%2Fg%2F1tggksmn?entry=ttu)

Checking the file type of the attached file shows this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/c7a44c8b-268c-431f-a645-0321fb19f65f)

It doesn't recognise it cause the file header is messed up 

So I used `xxd` to check the hex dump
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/962af485-bc9c-4f94-ba72-9165c8727c07)

We can see this `NETSCAPE2.0`

After doing research I found that it is a GIF file

And in order to fix it we need to append this to the file header `0x47494638`

I made a script to do that

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

buf = open('gift.gif', 'rb').read()
buf = b"\x47\x49\x46\x38" + buf
with open('fix.gif', 'wb') as fd:
    fd.write(buf)
```

Now we can check the file type for `fix.gif`
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/812da551-df91-4675-b44f-6eb619a86788)

Opening it shows some text file 
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/95b3d6f4-6209-4d40-9a85-ccd7653ce27a)

But since it is gif it removes and come back and I can't note the word 

So I used stegsolve to extract the frames
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/0b0c02a1-723a-4be1-a8d9-909bb9cd09a7)

Knowing that I just decoded it 

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
import base64
s='ZmxhZ3tnMWZfb3JfajFmfQ=='
print(base64.b64decode(s))
```

And got the flag

```

### Binary Exploitation 6/10 :~

#### BlackRop
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/ba882ce7-3452-4310-83f7-fb1af63976de)

After downloading the file and unzipping it I got this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/179782af-8b09-4845-807b-cbf251c439b1)

Source code is given
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/ad2f99d2-d0a8-4980-8336-1daef2abccdd)

From the source code we can see the main function calls the vuln function

And the vuln function is vulnerable to buffer overflow since it uses `gets()` to receive our input

```c
void vuln()
{
	char buffer[10];

	printf("check your identity and read the flag.\n");
	gets(buffer);
}
```

There's a win function called read_flag()

```c
void read_flag(){
	if(!(check_file && african && invite_code && capcha)) {
		printf("403|You aren't allowed to read the flag!\n");
		exit(1);
	}
	
	char flag[65];
	FILE * f = fopen("flag.txt","r");
	if (f == NULL){
		printf("flag.txt doesn't exist, try again on the server\n");
		exit(0);
	}
    fgets( flag, 65, f );
    printf("%s\n",flag);
    fflush(stdout);
}
```

But before it works it does a check on the global variables `check_file && african && invite_code && capcha`

And each of those variables are confirmed from other functions 

Like the check_file is set when check_flag function returns true

```c
void check_flag(char* file) {
	if(strcmp(file, "flag.txt") == 0) {
		check_file = 1;
	}
}
```

african is true when the african function returns true

```c
void check_african() {
	african = 1;
}
```

invite_code is true when the check_invitecode function returns true

```c
void check_invitecode(int code) {
	if(code == 0xbae) {
		invite_code = 1;
	}
}
```

capcha is true when the check_capcha function returns true

```c
void check_capcha(int login, int auth) {
	if(login == 0x062023 && auth == 0xbf1212) {
		capcha = 1;
	}
}
```

Since we know there's a buffer overflow that means we can overwrite the return address `EIP` and set it anywhere we like

And in x86 which is the binary architecture arguments are passed from the stack as fun, ret, arg1, arg2... Since the ret address in the next step will confuse the parameter passing, so ret is generally pressed

Now let us get the offset needed to overwrite the instruction pointer and I'll use gdb-gef for it
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/a96785a9-12bc-473d-9bb6-6e86b20171cd)

The offset is 22

I'll also need some pop gadgets

After downloading the attached file and unzipping it shows that the source code is given

Here's the content
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/e0b6688d-09fd-4d73-b6a6-24f0270f4a55)

```c
//gcc -o am1 am1.c -no-pie
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>


void print_file(char * file)
{
	char buffer[20];
	FILE * inputFile = fopen( file, "r" );
	if ( inputFile == NULL ) {
        printf( "Cannot open file %s\n", file );
        exit( -1 );
    }
    fgets( buffer, 65, inputFile );
    printf("Output: %s",buffer);
}

int main(){


    puts("Welcome to Africa battleCTF.");
    puts("Tell us something about you: ");
    char buf[0x30];
    gets( buf );

    return 0;
}
```

It's a small C file and here's what it does:
- The main function prints out some text and uses gets() to receive our input # bug here
- The function print_file is never called but what it does is to print out the content of what is passed in the argument

Now the aim of what we should do here is that since we know there's a buffer overflow since gets is used we can overwrite the RIP to call the print_file function then pass in a memory address containing `flag.txt` as the argument

But the issue is `flag.txt` isn't in the binary memory and we can't pass it as a string but rather an address

The way we can go around this is by writing the value of `flag.txt` in a writable section of the binary then call the print_file function on that address

Let us get the file type and the protection enabled on the binary
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/531ca267-bf12-442f-a579-6a6581dd1979)

This is a x64 binary which is dynamically linked and not stripped

The only protection enabled is NX (No Execute) which prevents shellcode upload to the stack and the execution of it

Now that we know that let us get a section of the binary which is writable 
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/0956a234-512e-46e0-8beb-cd2ab3238c92)

The `.data` section looks like a good candidate for this 

Now we need the offset and as usual i'll use gdb-gef for it
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/8499ede0-8437-44e2-ab99-b178957909cf)

Cool! The offset is 56

For x64 binary the calling convention is passed in via registers 

In this case we would need a pop rdi gadget

After downloading the attached file and unzipping it I got the source code and the binary
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/878efb5c-5663-4f4e-89d7-837c23a0682e)

```c
// gcc -o youpi youpi.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int check = 0;

void youpiii(){
	
	if(check){
		char buffer[20];
		FILE * inputFile = fopen("flag.txt", "r" );
		if ( inputFile == NULL ) {
		    printf( "Cannot open file flag.txt\n" );
		    exit( -1 );
		}
		fgets( buffer, 65, inputFile );
		printf("FLAG: %s",buffer);
	}

}

void main(){
    puts("Welcome to Africa battleCTF.");
    puts("Tell us about your country: ");
    char buf[0x30];
    gets( buf ); 
}
```

From the source code we can see what it does:
- The main function puts some text to stdout and receives our input using gets() #bug here
- The youpiii function which is never called reads the flag.txt file and prints it out but before that is done it checks if the check global variable is true

Since we can overwrite the RIP we can make the program to anywhere in the binary and therefore being able to skip the if check

So if we are to jump to this function we need to jump to `youpiii+18`
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/7e731144-b335-4973-841a-f6b679b77164)

Let us get the offset

The offset is 56 but now the issue is that we need to make the base pointer a known address since jumping to `youpiii+18` will make the rbp messed up

I just used the .data section 
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/490c0d60-a0ae-4bc8-a704-385f7dbb9432)

After downloading the attached file and unzipping it I got the binary

Let us check the file type and the protection enabled on it
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/7af56a69-0234-4c14-9acd-4093c46dadaa)

It's a x64 binary which is dynamically linked and not stripped and the only protection enabled on it is NX (No-Execute)

Since the source code isn't given i'll decompile it using IDA

Here's the main function
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/dfcbbffd-9987-459d-9d4e-ba95b702527c)

```c
int __cdecl main(int argc, const char **argv, const char **envp)
{
  char v4[48]; // [rsp+0h] [rbp-30h] BYREF

  system("echo 'Welcome to Africa battleCTF.\nTell us something about : '");
  gets(v4, argv);
  return 0;
}
```

We can see that it uses `system` to print some text and then use gets() to receive our input

So we have a buffer overflow here

Also the issue is that since system is used and system is called from the global offset table (GOT) we won't need to calculate the libc base address therefore we can call system directly 🙂

Let us get the offset needed to overwrite the RIP
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/2530e8a2-3846-4a25-8fbb-808155b103a9)

The offset is 56

But now we know that we can call system but we can't directly use a string as it's parameter but instead a memory address 

So we can get a writable section of the binary preferably `.data` and put `/bin/sh` into it therefore ropping to `system()`

I used rabin2 to get the .data section address
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/c490cf43-9c6e-4b05-b575-f24c95fec3f7)

Also we would need a pop rdi gadget since x64 argument are passed in via registers
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/b7413529-5ff9-4fd2-bf30-4269740046bf)

Now that it is settled here's what I'll do:
- Call gets() and our input will be stored in .data
- Call system(.data)

payload = flat({
    offset: [

After downloading the attached file and unzipping it I got the source code and the make file
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/afd4f885-1ff2-4e39-a9d7-d55539496992)

Checking the source code shows this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/5cb79293-44d4-4ef5-903a-db4e0a9b91fc)

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(){
	long pass;
	puts("Welcome to battleCTF Event portal.");
	printf("Enter you invite code to participe:");
	scanf("%s",&pass);
	if(pass * 0x726176656e70776eu == 0x407045989b3284aeu){
		execl("/bin/sh", "sh", 0);
	}
	else
		puts("\nWrong password ..!");
	return 0;
}

```

We can see after it prints out some text it then receives our input using scanf without specifying the amoung of data to read in (doesn't matter in this even though it's a buffer overflow)

It then compares the result formed from multilying our input with `0x726176656e70776eu` to `0x407045989b3284aeu`

If it returns true it spawns a shell

We can try to decode that value and try to get it's inverse but it isn't possible

So I used z3 which is a powerful framework for solving problems

[This](https://infosecadalid.com/2021/08/27/my-introduction-to-z3-and-solving-satisfiability-problems/) helped me with it 

Here's the script

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
from z3 import *

s = Solver()

x = BitVec("0", 64)

s.add(((x * 0x726176656e70776e) & 0xffffffffffffffff) == 0x407045989b3284ae)

if s.check() == sat:
    solution = s.model()
    solution = hex(int(str(solution[x])))
    solution = solution[2:]

    value = ""
    i = int(len(solution) / 2)
    while i > 0:
        i -= 1
        y = solution[(i*2):(i*2) + 2]
        value += chr(int("0x" + y, 16))

    print("Value: " + value)
else:
    print("Error")
```

Running it gives `anniepwn`

```
➜  eventportal python3 solve.py

```

Now I can connect to the remove instance and give that as the value

After downloading the file attached and unzipping it I got the binary but no source code

Let us check the file type and the protections enabled on it

We are working with a x64 binary which is dynamically linked, not stripped and the only protections enabled on it is NX

I decompiled it using ghidra and here's the main function
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/f3cb06fd-a94b-4545-85b5-34df152a388a)

```c

int main(void)

{
  char buf [48];
  
  puts("Africa battle CTF 2023");
  puts("Tell us about your ethnicity:");
  gets(buf);
  return 0;
}
```

We see there's a buffer overflow cause gets() is used and there's also another function called hausa

Here's it decompiled code
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/820dbaf7-42c6-494d-9d2d-f9443f18ca59)

```c

undefined8 hausa(void)

{
  return 0xf;
}
```

It returns 0xf which is an essential assembly instruction needed for performing Sigreturn Oriented Programming (SROP) 

In the hood it does
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/93665173-11ab-4e10-9ee6-ec857a414106)

Which is basically:
-  mov eax, 0xf; ret;

Since our exploitation technique will be SROP I need to search if there's /bin/sh in the binary

And luckily there was
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/0bcf0c75-64ba-4323-a421-f9d2f27b6234)

How will I take advantage of this?

First we need to know what syscall is 
- A syscall is a system call, and is how the program enters the kernel in order to carry out specific tasks such as creating processes, I/O and any others they would require kernel-level access.

And how do we trigger a syscall
- On Linux, a syscall is triggered by the int80 instruction. Once it's called, the kernel checks the value stored in RAX - this is the syscall number, which defines what syscall gets run. As per the table, the other parameters can be stored in RDI, RSI, RDX, etc and every parameter has a different meaning for the different syscalls.

A notable syscall is the execve syscall, which executes the program passed to it in RDI. RSI and RDX hold arvp and envp respectively.

This means, if there is no system() function, we can use execve to call /bin/sh instead - all we have to do is pass in a pointer to /bin/sh to RDI, and populate RSI and RDX with 0 (this is because both argv and envp need to be NULL to pop a shell).

And luckily pwntool can allow us interact with sigreturn

From there we can see it does a simple calculation

I just did the same thing but with python here's the script

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
a = 0x522d1b20f6
b = a + 0x1ee2eeee
c = b ^ 0xaa84aaa
print(bytes.fromhex(hex(c)[2:]))
```

Running it gives:

So here's how I came about it

From the assembly instruction it does

```asm
   0x0000000000401000 <+0>:     movabs rbx,0x522d1b20f6
   0x000000000040100a <+10>:    mov    rax,rbx
   0x000000000040100d <+13>:    add    rax,0x1ee2eeee
   0x0000000000401013 <+19>:    nop
   0x0000000000401014 <+20>:    xor    rax,0xaa84aaa
```

And what that does is:
- Stores the value of `0x522d1b20f6` to the rbx
- Moves the rbx to the rax
- Adds `0x1ee2eeee` to the rax
- Xors the rax with `0xaa84aaa`

```

After downloading the binary I checked the file type
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/35a7f3d6-ebbf-4556-b792-be41a91e5a9a)

We are working with x64 binary which is dynamically linked and not stripped

When I tried running it I got seg fault
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/0a6ee577-b19a-44ad-acf1-4581396a8ecb)

I opened it up in gdb then saw this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/918d88a7-286d-433d-a9b1-8a808759038f)

Disassemblying it gives this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/cd227f3d-325b-4900-9472-6674d136c05e)

Looking at that we can see some push instruction which will cause the stack to be unstable causing the seg fault

I took those values out and on decoding it I got this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/dc3c3d40-456b-4cd1-8f95-ac7793fa3027)

After some minutes on looking at it I got the right flag from it

```

After downloading the file I checked the file type
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/974b0710-cf7f-47ab-92de-042bbbe9eb25)

We are working with a x64 binary which is dynamically linked and not stripped

I ran the binary and it showed this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/50c1ccca-efb8-45bb-a5ff-79bb5ff7f354)

I decompiled it using IDA and here's the main function
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/239f3dd0-b2a1-46df-afab-25485e0f6d28)

```c
int __cdecl main(int argc, const char **argv, const char **envp)
{
  char s[112]; // [rsp+0h] [rbp-70h] BYREF

  puts("Welcome to battleCTF invite code verification portal.");
  printf("Enter your invite code to verify: ");
  fgets(s, 100, stdin);
  encrypt(s, 15LL);
  if ( !strcmp(s, _TMC_END__) )
    puts("Valid code... !");
  else
    puts("Invalid code...!");
  return 0;
}
```

We can see what it does:
- After it prints out some words it receives out input which is stored in array s
- It then calls the encrypt function on our value
- After it does that a string compare is done against the s value and _TMC_END__
- If it is right it prints valid code else invalid code

Here's the value of _TMC_END__:

```
qpiiatRIU{Pvqp_Ugt3_UDDS_Stn_d0D!_85864r1277qu8195pqqtp6540494pr46}
```

I didn't take a look at the encrypt function since I saw strcmp is used 🙂

We can cheat our way around here 😜

I opened up gdb-pwngdb and set a breakpoint at the strcmp call with `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz` as my input
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/d0e59a8c-00f2-4a0d-9a2e-08ecc2e802e2)

Now you can see the strcmp call on our encrypted input with the flag compared value
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/21052480-6735-4c72-a463-9b772a7f378a)

Since we know our input will be turned to: `pqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmno` and it's compared against `qpiiatRIU{Pvqp_Ugt3_UDDS_Stn_d0D!_85864r1277qu8195pqqtp6540494pr46}` 

I can match it to get the right input:

```
a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
p q r s t u v w x y z a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o
```

After doing that I got the flag

```

We are working with a x64 binary which is dynamically linked and it's stripped

On running shows the invite code prompt as the previous one

Decompiling it in IDA here's the main function
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/7ec82163-175b-4a45-9c89-b75c90de853e)

```c
__int64 __fastcall main(int a1, char **a2, char **a3)
{
  char s[112]; // [rsp+0h] [rbp-70h] BYREF

  puts("Welcome to battleCTF invite code verification portal.");
  printf("Enter your invite code to verify: ");
  fgets(s, 100, stdin);
  sub_1179(s);
  if ( !strcmp(s, s2) )
    puts("Valid code... !");
  else
    puts("Invalid code...!");
  return 0LL;
}
```

It uses strcmp again !! Very good

I'll cheat my way around here again

Following the way I solved the previous one you should get this

```
a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z a b c d e

expected = gfyyqjHYK{Flg4_d0z_i3d_xr0p3_1lg0?}
```

From there we can map the char of the flag to be:

```
Flag: battleCTF{Agb4_y0u_d3y_sm0k3_1gb0?}
```

We can reverse that 

I made a script to reverse it

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

key = 0x41ef12
flag = []

val1 = 0x62209b66
flag.append(bytes.fromhex(hex(val1 ^ key)[2:]))

val2 = 0x6c24ac46
flag.append(bytes.fromhex(hex(val2 ^ key)[2:]))

val3 = 0x463abc23
flag.append(bytes.fromhex(hex(val3 ^ key)[2:]))

val4 = 0x6d318377
flag.append(bytes.fromhex(hex(val4 ^ key)[2:]))

val5 = 0x5f0c8064
flag.append(bytes.fromhex(hex(val5 ^ key)[2:]))

val6 = 0x492fbc7a
flag.append(bytes.fromhex(hex(val6 ^ key)[2:]))
 
val7 = 0x652d836f
flag.append(bytes.fromhex(hex(val7 ^ key)[2:]))

print(b''.join(flag))
```

Running it gives the flag

From looking at the given script I figured that to solve it the inverse will be calculated with gaussian elimination

But this would work faster too

```python
from sage.all import *

var('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')

solution = solve([1245115057305148164 == 2*a*98**4 + b*98**3 + c*98**2+d*98+e,

            break
    else:
        print(f"Couldn't solve '{ciphertext}' in bytes")
print(pt)
```

5 unknown variables can be solved with 5 equations. After this you have the random polynomial, and you could either calculate the inverse of it to get the plaintext or you could also substract the ciphertext value from the polynomial and then the plaintext should be one of the zeros of that new polynomial.

```python
1245115057305148164 = 2*a*98^4 + b*98^3 + c*98^2+d*98+e
1835524676869638124 = 2*a*108^4 + b*108^3 + c*108^2+d*108+e
1195140205147730541 = 2*a*97^4 + b*97^3 + c*97^2+d*97+e
2441940832124642988 = 2*a*116^4 + b*116^3 + c*116^2+d*116+e
1404473868033353193 = 2*a*101^4 + b*101^3 + c*101^2+d*101+e
```

With that, running it gives the flag

I also solved it by using Gausssian Elimination
